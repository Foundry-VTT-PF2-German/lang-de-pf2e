          "name": "Anadi",
          "text": "<p><em>Anadi people are reclusive, sapient spiders who hail from the jungles of southern Garund. Though they act in many ways like natural-born shapeshifters, their twin forms actually stem from carefully developed magic.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>As a communal and peaceful people, anadi ancestors endeavored to establish trade with the neighbors of ttheir homeland. However, these anadi soon learned that most others found their appearance to be extremely objectionable. Wishing to avoid conflict, ancient anadi retreated into isolation until they could find a solution. The answer came when their greatest scholars innovated a fusion of transmutation and illusion magic that allowed them to assume a humanoid form. The technique was developed, perfected, and eventually taught to the overwhelming majority of anadi.</p>\n<p>Early efforts with their new approach to diplomacy have yielded much better results, though sporadic contact means that some outsiders whisper false legends about anadi, such as claims that they are humans who transform into monstrous spiders at moonrise. Even contemporary explorers have reported anadi as human-spider hybrids. The anadi people of the current day strive to slowly but surely create a world where they no longer need to hide their true nature.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Only reveal your true form to people who have earned your trust.</li>\n<li>Openly express sympathy for misrepresented and unfairly stigmatized cultures.</li>\n<li>Provide for those you hold dear and defend them from danger without hesitation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your willingness to seek nonviolent solutions to complicated problems.</li>\n<li>Have a strong reaction to seeing your natural form.</li>\n<li>Assume you have an affinity for druidic magic, given your ability to transform.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Anadi in their true form resemble human-sized spiders with a variety of colorations. Some tones look simple or muted while other remain striking and vibrant, with most patterns inherited from an anadi's parentage. A typical anadi measures five feet in length from their front legs to their rear legs when standing comfortably.</p>\n<p>All anadi possesses the ability to transform into a human guise. This form can resemble any human ethnicity, but it's usually one that blends in with the region of an anadi's hatching. Anadi reach physical maturity after 13 years, going through multiple phases of molting along the way. A typical anadi lives to be about 80 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Anadi live in a communal society, sharing peaceful lives farming mushrooms or weaving warm blankets. Their culture places great value on cooperation and mutual respect. Due to this cultural upbringing, anadi often have issues facing severe conflict and often come off to other ancestries as very shy. Their history of dealing with arachnophobia in other peoples-which anadi understand is often instinctual and very difficult to control-likewise means that anadi do their best to be accommodating and comforting, even in situations that aren't necessarily fair to them.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>The cooperative nature of anadi society and their dislike of violence means many anadi lean toward good alignments. They're more often neutral than chaotic or lawful, though the latter aren't unheard of.</p>\n<p>Legends say Grandmother Spider rescued anadi people from servitude and brought them to Golarion, becoming their patron deity in the process. Her values of mutual care and playful trickery interweave into anadi culture, and even those who don't worship her tell tales of her adventures.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Anadi names are given by the members of the web marriage that raised them. Each parent contributes a single syllable, usually the first, from their own name. Older anadi who feel their identity has settled often take on or are given a phrase-title to honor them as well. Anadi who live among human populations rarely take a cover name, but some might adopt one if their given name strongly contrasts the norm in the local culture.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Altava, Anavachti, Strings-On-The-River Inkeelah, Kerialnamu, Maracha, Leaves-Shelter-Her-Feet Naiala, Orvasa, Reloana, Rivuken, Velachamon</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Anadi Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Constitution</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Anadi, Mwangi</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "name": "Androide",
          "text": "<p><em>Technological wonders from another world, androids have synthetic bodies and living souls. Their dual nature makes them quick-thinking and calm under pressure, but comfortable in stillness and solitude.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Androids first arrived on Golarion during the Rain of Stars, when an interstellar vessel from the far-off planet of Androffa crash-landed, scattering debris across Numeria. While some android survivors of this crash still walk Golarion today, most were created from the technological pods, known as foundries, that operate sporadically amid the starship's wreckage. Androids birthed from these mechanical wombs possess mature bodies and newborn souls, both organic and synthetic; they emerge knowing only their creators' language and the motor skills necessary for survival. They have no understanding of their surroundings, origin, or purpose. Most learn how to behave through keen observation while wandering Numeria.</p>\n<p>Androids tend to be logical introverts, rational and contemplative. Insatiably curious, with an urge to understand themselves and the world around them, androids place great value on intellectual pursuits. They have difficulty interpreting and expressing emotions, both in themselves and in others, which makes them seem distant and uncaring. While androids can forge emotional bonds, they find it more difficult to connect with non-androids.</p>\n<p>If you want a character that's a synthetic foreigner in a fantastic world, forced to learn the nuances of reality and society through the powers of observation and logic alone, you should play an android.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your identity a secret, assuming others want to exploit or harm you.</li>\n<li>Plan ahead, preparing multiple contingencies for even simple tasks.</li>\n<li>Calculate the repercussions of your actions, inventions, and thoughts before sharing them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you understand how to operate technology and that you can capably communicate with constructs and robots.</li>\n<li>Believe you to be immortal and envy your eternal youth and vigor.</li>\n<li>Think you have no feelings and that you can't form emotional connections with others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Androids were created in humanity's image; thus, foundries produce androids that represent all humankind. Androids display great diversity in coloration and ethnicity, height and body shape, and gender identity. Androids breathe, eat, and sleep like a human, although they're incapable of biological procreation. Their bodies contain microscopic nanites, transported by fluid too watery to be blood, that manage their organic processes. These nanites are controlled through biological circuitry that resembles tattoos and is typically located along an android's hands, forearms, face, or neck. Many androids can harness their nanites to increase their bodies' efficiency, causing the circuitry to glow.</p>\n<p>Androids don't grow old. Instead, their organic appearance becomes less convincing over time, causing them to look more artificial. After a century, most androids feel their time coming to an end and willingly release their souls to the Boneyard to face Pharasma's judgment. Their bodies then shut down, entering a lifeless hibernation as their nanites begin restoration protocol and reset their synthetic bodies to their original manufactured state. After a few weeks, a new soul enters the android's form, triggering reinitialization. This process, called Renewal, is an event to be celebrated, akin to bearing a child. Those that die by violence can't Renew, so androids go to great lengths to protect themselves and their brethren from harm.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Androids have a history of being exploited, enslaved, and destroyed by their Numerian neighbors, so they hide in order to survive. Most choose to keep their ancestry secret by integrating into human society or by adapting to a nomadic lifestyle. Some androids eschew humanity to live among their kind. Such groups often remain small by necessity; while a pair of androids can avoid danger through careful secrecy, large groups attract too much attention.</p>\n<p>Android communities are efficient and highly organized. Each citizen understands their role and takes pride in filling it effectively. Debates and lectures frequently occur, as androids seek to understand themselves and their world through education and inquiry. These insular and secretive enclaves relocate when discovered.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Most androids are neutral. They care for their own safety and that of their companions and their kind. Androids interested in religion usually worship Casandalee or Brigh, goddesses that unite invention and life. Other popular deities include Desna, Irori, and Gozreh.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Androids adopt the naming conventions of their surrounding societies, while those raised among their own kind instead select a single name that utilizes Androffan phonology. Occasionally, such androids add a numerical designation to their names, denoting how many generations their body has hosted life as a kind of homage to their bloodline.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Anati, Daniv, Era-4, Feralia, Gelegor, Ilgos-5, Koresh, Oris, Prime, Urdun, Verity-3, Ymry</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Android Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Androffan</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "name": "Athamaru",
          "text": "<p>Athamarus sind fischartige Humanoide, die eng zusammenhaltende Unterwassergemeinschaften bilden. Ihre kleinen Ortschaften leben von der Seetang- und Algenzucht. Man trainiert Aale als Reittiere und schafft Kunstwerke aus Korallen. Die Beziehungen zu anderen aquatischen Abstammungen sind angespannt, da Athamarus von vielen schlecht behandelt werden. Dennoch sind sie potentiellen Kontakten gegenüber aufgeschlossen und neugierig, welche neuen Möglichkeiten sicher- öffnen könnten.</p>\n<p>Athamarus definieren sich über ihre Verbindungen zur Welt um sie herum. Sie leben in Gemeinden um Korallenriffe und mit aquatischen Gefährten, die Großfamilien und große Freundesgruppen fördern. Athamarische Ansiedlungen nahe Fluss- oder Meereshandelsrouten unterhalten normalerweise starke Kontakte zu den regelmäßig vorbeifahrenden Seeleuten, indem man Korallenschmuck oder Informationen über Meeresbedingungen in der Nähe gegen Güter von der Oberfläche tauscht. Besonders begehrt ist dabei Wurzelgemüse wie Knollen, Yams und anderes, was als Delikatessen betrachtet wird.</p>\n<p>Falls du einen Charakter spielen willst, der Wert auf die Gemeinschaft legt und im Meer aus eigener Kraft überleben kann, solltest du einen Athamaru in Erwägung ziehen.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest...</h2><ul>\n<li>deine Gemeinschaft über alles andere stellen.</li>\n<li>Fremden mit freundlicher Neugier begegnen.</li>\n</ul><h2>Andere könnten...</h2><ul>\n<li>annehmen, dass du ein Meister im Überleben unter Wasser bist.</li>\n<li>dich für üble Gerüche verantwortlich machen.</li>\n</ul><h2>Körperliche Beschreibung</h2>\n<p>Athamarus ähneln in ihrem Äußeren Fischen. Die helle Haut passt farblich oft zu den Riffen, an denen sie ihre Dörfer bauen. Krausen, Bartel und gezackte Finnen runden diesen Eindruck ab. Schuppenmuster, Formen von Finnen und Krausen und andere Merkmale machen die Unterscheidung zwischen ihnen leicht, selbst wenn eine Gemeinschaft vielleicht gemeinsame Merkmale besitzt. Diese Ähnlichkeiten verleihen oftmals Vorteile in der heimatlichen Umgebung, seien es Schuppen, die farbig zu Seetang passen, oder längere Zehen bei kiesbedeckten Gewässerböden.</p>\n<p>Fremde bemerken oft, dass Athamarus einen ausgeprägten Geruch aufweisen. Dieser entspringt Pheromonen, welche zur Kommunikation und zur Verteidigung genutzt werden. Wie gut ein Athamaru diese Duftstoffe kontrollieren kann, ist vom Individuum abhängig, aber alle sind imstande, einfache Emotionen auf chemischer Basis mitzuteilen. Nahezu jede Ortschaft hat obendrein eigene Variationen ihrer Pheromone und hinterlässt so einen eigenen Abdruck. Meister der Duftstoffe können komplexe philosophische Konzepte allein auf diese Weise übermitteln und nehmen Positionen ein, ähnlich der Meistersänger anderer Abstammungen.</p>\n<p>Athamarus schätzen natürlichen Schmuck, der die Grenze zwischen Körpermodifikationen und Juwelen verwischt. Wo Korallen wachsen, pflegt man eifrig die Riffe und die dortigen symbiotischen Arten. Manche Athamarus formen lebende Exemplare zu Ohrringen oder Armreifen und lenken auf sanfte Weise das weitere Wachstum dieser Korallen. Diese Schmuckstücke werden oft über Generationen hinweg vererbt und als lebende Stücke der Geschichte der Gemeinschaft verstanden. In anderen Fällen werden Korallen als Symbionten in den eigenen Körper integriert; die Korallen liefern Nährstoffe, während der Athamaru dafür sorgt, dass sie Sonnenlicht und geeignetes Wasser erhalten.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Die größte Athamarupopulation lebt im Golf von Xidao in Tian Xia im Unterwasserreich Xidao. Dort existieren kleinere Stadtstaaten mit jeweils eigenen Regierungen und Anführern, die aber ein gemeinsames Schutz- und Trutzbündnis gegen die Schrecken der Tiefe geschlossen haben. Der größte dieser Stadtstaaten, Yashabaru, besitzt keine direkte Kontrolle über die anderen Ortschaften, sein Oberhaupt fungiert aber als Gesicht der Region gegenüber anderen Ländern. Außerhalb von Xidao sind die Gemeinden isolierter und unabhängiger. Es gibt Populationszentren im Bereich des Fesselinselarchipels und den Golfen Arkadiens und eine abgeschiedene Ortschaft nahe Sedeq.</p>\n<p>In den kleinsten Athamarudörfern lebt vielleicht nur ein Dutzend Leute, in den größten dagegen hunderte. Ihre Gemeinschaften verbinden sich mit anderen aquatischen Bewohnern und bauen starke Bande auf, welche die Lebensqualität der Beteiligten verbessern. Tiere werden in die Gemeinschaften als Partner integriert, das gilt besonders für die gezähmten Aale, welche von den Athamarus als Reittiere genutzt werden. Die Aale streifen in der Regel frei umher und die Athamarus trainieren diese freigeschlüpften Aale zu Reittieren, während sie sie großziehen.</p>\n<p>Jede Gemeinschaft besteht aus genetisch verwandten Athamarus, die ihre Stammbäume meistens auf ein gemeinsames Elternteil zurückführen können. In den meisten Niederlassungen ist dieses Elternteil als die Matriarchin bekannt und fungiert als Oberhaupt. Naht das Lebensende der Matriarchin oder legt sie keine Eier mehr, unterwerfen sich mehrere der lokalen Athamarus freiwillig körperlichen Veränderungen, darunter auch einem Wachstumsschub, um ihre Absicht zu erklären, den Platz der Matriarchin zu übernehmen. Diese Entscheidung wird nicht leichthin gefällt, da der Anführer für das Überleben der Gemeinschaft und ihren Weiterbestand verantwortlich ist. Jede Gemeinde hat ihre eigenen Methoden, die nächste Matriarchin aus diesen Bewerberinnen auszuwählen. Es mag sich um demokratische Wahlen handeln, Wissensprüfungen und/oder Wettbewerbe im körperlichen Können wie Tieftauchen oder Reiten auf ungezähmten Tieren. In Xidao müssen die Kandidatinnen der Stadtstaaten vor der Hohen Matriarchin und ihrem Rat vorstellig werden und sich als würdig erweisen, die Transformation beenden zu können.</p>\n<p>Manchmal trennen sich junge Erwachsene von der Gemeinschaft, um eigene, neue Dörfer zu gründen. Dies passiert meistens, wenn Ressourcen knapp werden oder es zu internen Konflikten kommt. Sollte eine Gruppe dann Schwierigkeiten haben, irgendwo Fuß zu fassen, wird ihr oft die Heimkehr erlaubt, sofern sie bereit ist, sich der Führungsspitze wieder zu unterwerfen.</p>\n<p>Da Athamarus in der Vergangenheit von anderen Gruppierungen schlecht behandelt wurden, halten sie eng zusammen und betrachten es als weniger riskant, mit ihresgleichen Geschäfte zu machen. Neben dem Handel untereinander teilen sie auch Informationen – Warnungen hinsichtlich Gefahren verbreiten sich rasch, ebenso wie Informationen über vertrauenswürdige Landbewohner, tolerante Marktplätze und andere Gelegenheiten. Nichtathamarus können das Vertrauen der Athamarus aber schnell verspielen und dann vielleicht niemals wiedererlangen. Die meisten Athamarus fliehen lieber, als offene Feindseligkeiten zu riskieren. In manchen Fällen sucht sich dann eine ganze Dorfgemeinschaft einen neuen Ort zum Siedeln.</p>\n<p>Athamarische Namen bestehen meistens aus drei Silben. Die erste Silbe tragen alle Angehörigen derselben Generation, die anderen beiden identifizieren ein Individuum. Außerhalb der Gemeinschaft stellen sie sich zuerst mit ihren Gemeinschaftsnamen vor. Manche Gemeinschaften – insbesondere die von Xidao – brechen mit dieser Tradition, doch selbst die dort vergebenen Namen identifizieren Athamarus, die im selben Jahr geschlüpft sind.</p>\n<h3>Beispielnamen</h3>\n<p>Aussandor, Cayiel, Corlena, Mithae, Onteac, Paquotal</p>\n<h2>Glauben und Religion</h2>\n<p>Da Athamarus die Gemeinschaft sehr wichtig ist, bevorzugen sie Religionen und Philosophien, welche den Fokus auf die Verbindung und Unterstützung anderer legen. Sie wissen auch, dass sie zuweilen Schutz vor den Gefahren der See benötigen, weshalb manche Athamarus zu standhaften Beschützern oder religiösen Gestalten werden, welche bei gewogenen Göttern um Hilfe bitten. Eine Gemeinschaft verehrt meistens eine Gottheit, so dass mehrere Tempel im gleichen Ort eher selten sind. In der Region der Inneren See verehrt man meistens Gozreh zwecks Stärkung der Bande zur Umgebung oder Erastil, um Anleitung für den Erhalt und Zusammenhalt der Gemeinschaft zu erlangen. In Tian Xia wenden sich Athamarus an Hei Feng, den Herzog des Donners, bei launischem Wetter und verzwickter Politik. Und jene Athamarus, die sich den Schrecken der Tiefe entgegenstellen, beten zu den drei Kriegsgöttern Srikalis, Sritaming und Sribaril um Stärke.</p>\n<p><strong>Verbreitete Gebote</strong></p>\n<p>Suche neue Erfahrungen fern deines Geburtsortes; führe deine Gemeinschaft in eine bessere Zukunft</p>\n<p><strong>Verbreitete Anathemata</strong></p>\n<p>Verrate deine Gemeinschaft; füge deiner Gemeinschaft wissentlich Schaden zu</p>\n<h2>Spielmechanik</h2>\n<p><strong>Seltenheit</strong> Ungewöhnlich</p>\n<p><strong>Trefferpunkte</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Größenkategorie</strong> Mittelgroß</p>\n<p><strong>Bewegungsrate</strong> 20 Fuß/6 m, Schwimmen 25 Fuß/7,50 m</p>\n<p><strong>Attributsverstärkungen</strong> Stärke, Weisheit, Frei</p>\n<p><strong>Attributsschwäche</strong> Intelligenz</p>\n<p><strong>Sprachen</strong> Gemeinsprache, Thalassal, Weitere Sprachen in Höhe deines Intelligenzbonus.

        "Automaton": {
          "name": "Automat",
          "text": "<p><em>These intelligent constructs house actual souls and represent what remains of a dying empire's last attempt at greatness. Automatons combine technological ingenuity with magical power, creating a blended being wholly unique to Golarion.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Jistka Imperium was the first major human civilization to emerge after Earthfall, arising around the area that would later become Rahadoum and enduring for seven centuries thanks to great advancements in civics and the sciences. However, Jistka's leaders often favored aggressive uses of technology, and early advances paved the way for arrogance, petty infighting, and corruption. The Jistka Imperium's expansionist tendencies and lack of diplomacy earned the Imperium many enemies over the course of its existence. The most notable of these foes was the empire of Ancient Osirion. Osirion's enmity ultimately sealed the Imperium's fate, as they employed clever and depraved magic that proved more than a match for Jistka's legendary golem army, even when the Jistkans began to cut corners and bind fiends into their golems. In a desperate attempt to fight back against internal corruption and external pressures, a cabal of concerned Jistkans formed the Artificer Conclave to develop new technologies to stave off the Imperium's collapse and return Jistka to its former glory. The most successful of these developments were automatons, which the Conclave believed to be the pinnacle of Jistkan constructs-or at least, the last hope for Jistka's salvation. Conclave creators transplanted the mind, life force, and soul of Jistkan individuals into these constructs, creating magical and technological marvels powered by the life energy of the greatest warriors and scholars the organization could recruit. Unfortunately, despite the Conclave's best efforts, the automatons' arrival happened too late to save the already doomed Imperium. The empire collapsed, leaving automatons to fend for themselves.</p>\n<p>The exceptional and forward-thinking construction of automatons means that a fair number remain today, millennia later, scattered to the winds. However, the passage of time has revealed one of automatons' greatest weaknesses: their mortal psyches. Only the strongest willed have managed to retain their memories, sense of self, and lucidity after all this time. As each automaton remains as unique as any living person on Golarion; a given automaton has their own personality, shaped by countless experiences. Most automatons behave reclusively, preferring to avoid others due to fear of attachment or misunderstanding. Even automatons who are more willing to live in the open understand that their unique nature makes them a prime target for hunters, scholars, or worse. Rare is the automaton that lives without the regular occurrence of distrust or worry.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have lived for several centuries and through many significant events.</li>\n<li>Be hesitant to trust others until they've earned it.</li>\n<li>Remember little of your life before becoming an automaton.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mistake you for a mindless construct when they first see you.</li>\n<li>Assume you have secret knowledge about magic and technology.</li>\n<li>Look upon you with awe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Automatons share a common construction-a blend of magically treated metals and stone. This design allows automatons to withstand the rigors of direct combat and makes them particularly hardy. Their heavy bodies can move just as quickly as other combatants, making automatons intimidating foes. The design of an automaton varies depending on the needs of its role. Most automatons have a basic humanoid shape, though some instead have shapes that closely resemble animals. The majority of automatons have a single eye that glows with a dim, magical light. Each also contains a powerful artifact that both houses its individual soul and uses a combination of life and planar energy for power. These automaton cores are marvels of magical engineering whose method of creation has been lost to time.</p>\n<p>As constructs, automatons typically don't need to breathe, eat, or sleep; however, the body of an automaton needs to vent an imperceivable magical exhaust at a constant rate. This venting process requires breathable air to prevent a buildup of exhaust that can clog the automaton's systems, sometimes to fatal effect. Thus, automatons can still suffocate much like living creatures. Though they don't sleep, automatons require a period of magical recalibration and restoration which stabilizes the energies within their core. Without this process, an automaton core is incapable of fully powering the automaton and they enter an inefficient state (similar to a humanoid who doesn't get 8 hours of sleep).</p>\n<p>Automatons don't age and the design of their cores grants them a seemingly endless power source. Many automatons that exist today are thousands of years old, their bodies as efficient as the day of their creation, even if their minds might have deteriorated with the strain of the ages. Automatons lost over time typically met violent ends. An automaton's body is just as vulnerable to destruction as any other construct, though destroying an automaton core is more difficult. As such, an automaton's soul might remain trapped within its core for years after the destruction of its body. This was the intent of the original creators, who hoped to provide functional immortality. However, in reality, the destruction of the body more often leads to a malfunction, requiring magical intervention such as resurrection magic to restore the automaton completely. In the case of the core's destruction, or if it malfunctions catastrophically enough that it can no longer hold the soul, the core releases the spirit to the River of Souls.</p>\n<p>In some cases, an automaton can learn how to consciously or subconsciously influence its core. These automatons eventually learn how to release their souls from their cores, allowing their souls to move on when they feel they have achieved a satisfying life. This act leaves the automaton as a mindless construct, typically still active but no longer capable of anything but aimless wandering and occasional acts of self-defense.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Due to the disparate fates of automatons, many of them lead solitary lives. There are a few cases of automatons originally designed to work together, such as groups of warriors, who remain as a team and dwell together in hideouts or travel together as wanderers. These groups are few and far between, however, and automaton settlements are even rarer. The only pockets of automatons that begin to resemble settlements typically hide among the ruins of Jistka. These groups can hold dozens of automatons, but any attempts to contact or visit them tend to be fruitless. Such gatherings are especially secretive, and the resident automatons will protect their homes at any cost.</p>\n<p>Automatons are far more likely to encounter other ancestries. Depending on the automaton's personality, this encounter could go a number of ways, ranging from extreme secrecy to open visitation. An automaton's unique appearance makes them stand out regardless of where they're found, but most others look upon them with awe or curiosity rather than fear. Magical constructs aren't an alien concept across Golarion, but many of them are mindless. After making it past the initial shock of a thinking construct, it's often not difficult for most grasp how to engage with an automaton. However, automatons are more likely to find the semblance of an everyday life in large cities like Absalom, Azir, or Quantium. Regardless of where they go, an automaton must remain on the lookout for those who would attempt to take their body for study or to access their core.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>The people of the Jistka Imperium saw the aeons of Axis as ideal beings whose behavior was worthy of emulation, so many Jistkans were lawful neutral. Since many automatons contain Jistkan souls, most automatons are lawful neutral, or at least lawful in some capacity. Over the centuries, however, a fair number of automatons have drifted toward neutral alignments as their outlooks change without a primary society or set of ideals upon which to cling. Automatons tend to worship gods of technology or magic like Brigh and Nethys, or various monitor demigods. Worship of Irori and Pharasma are somewhat common among automatons as well. Pharasmin automatons likely learn how to release their souls from their cores, and often choose to do so. Though they are ancient beings from long before the time of Casandalee, a small number of automatons have recognized the new artificial goddess as a kindred spirit.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>An automaton typically keeps the name they had before their transformation into a construct, if they can remember it. Even when other memories fade, memory of their name often remains. As such, many automatons have names with Jistkan origins. Second most common are automatons who had to give themselves a new name, as they lost their memories of the old one at some point. Those automatons that particularly believed in the cause of the Artificer Conclave might instead take the name of one of the conclave's members in honor of the cause that they gave their body to support. Some automatons prefer to change their names over their lifetimes, either selecting a new name from a culture they encountered or adding a title to represent a significant moment in their lives. In some cases an automaton will use a particularly cherished title in place of any other name.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Alnhaman, Busmin, The Doleful, Enoh, Himar, Kantral, The Kindred, Numinar, Scholar, Tehkis, Wayfarer, Yulmian</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Automaton Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium or Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Utopian</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

This life energy flows through you much like the blood of humanoids. As a result, you are a living creature. You don't have the typical construct immunities, can be affected by effects that target a living creature, and can recover Hit Points normally via vitality energy. Additionally, you are not destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. Instead, your life energy attempts to keep you active even in dire straits; you are knocked out and begin dying when reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p>\n<p><strong>Constructed Body</strong> Your physiological needs are different than those of living creatures. You don't need to eat or drink. You don't need to sleep, but you still need a daily period of rest. During this period of rest, you must enter a recuperating standby state for 2 hours, which is similar to sleeping except you are aware of your surroundings and don't take penalties for being unconscious. Much like with sleeping, if you go too long without entering your standby state, you become fatigued and can't recover until you enter standby for 2 hours.</p>\n<h2>Automaton Heritages</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.2kMltxs2rmxRSxfV]{Hunter Automaton}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.J0eAmntxXywr9sGt]{Mage Automaton}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.j1nzBc9Pui7vsJ9o]{Sharpshooter Automaton}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.y24ykEUfpIu5Gp6D]{Warrior Automaton}</p>"

          "name": "Erwecktes Tier",
          "text": "<p>Früher konntest du die einfachen und endlosen Freuden der Natur mit unschuldigem, unbelastetem Geist genießen. Du hast von Augenblick zu Augenblick gelebt, dich niemals gefragt, was als nächstes kommt, oder über die Folgen des Vergangenen nachgedacht. Du bist eins mit der Wildnis gewesen. Dann aber kam das Ereignis, das alles verändert hat. Du hast aus einem leuchtenden Teich getrunken, jemand hat dir einen magischen Streich gespielt oder vielleicht wollte ein Druide dir etwas Gutes tun. Und so wurdest du aus dem ewigen Jetzt der Wildnis in das Land der Gedanken und des Nachdenkens geschleudert. Erstmals im Leben wurde dir klar, dass du eine Vergangenheit hattest. Zum allerersten Mal fingst du an, über deine Zukunft nachzudenken.</p>\n<p>Jetzt erlebst du die Welt auf völlig neue Weise. Du erkennst Gefahren, die dir vorher nie aufgefallen wären, doch wenigstens gibt in dieser neuen Welt auch eine Fülle an Freuden und Wundern. Und das ist etwas Gutes, da es kein Zurück mehr zum Früheren gibt…</p>\n<p>Erweckte Tiere waren einst normale Tiere, bis etwas ihren Verstand geweckt und ihnen vollständige Intelligenz und die Gabe verliehen hat, die Welt durch das Prisma des Denkens zu betrachten. Es gibt viele mysteriöse Wege, um Tiere zu erwecken, wobei der bekannteste das Ritual @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.B4dDkYsHFo1H0CIF]{Tier erwecken} ist.</p>\n<p>Jedes Tier reagiert auf den Erweckungsprozess anders. Für manche ist er elektrifizierend – plötzlich können sie die Welt wahrnehmen und ihre Eindrücke verarbeiten wie nie zuvor. Andere werden von Gedanken und Gefühlen überwältigt, um die sie nicht gebeten haben und für die sie nicht bereit sind. Die meisten Leute, die ein Tier erwecken wollen, gehen davon aus, dass es voller Begeisterung und Dankbarkeit sein wird, und sind daher nicht auf die Fülle potentieller Reaktionen vorbereitet – Schock, Traurigkeit, Euphorie, Neugier und Zorn treten häufig auf, sind aber nur ein paar Möglichkeiten.</p>\n<p>Egal wie ein Erwecktes Tier reagiert, es muss sich immer noch in der Welt zurechtfinden. Manche versuchen, zu ihren alten Leben zurückzukehren, müssen meistens aber feststellen, dass sie mit ihren nicht erweckten Artgenossen nicht mehr zurechtkommen. Andere widmen sich der Zivilisation und bemü- hen sich, sich in der Welt der Humanoiden zurechtzufinden. Letztendlich werden erweckte Tiere immer wieder zwischen Zivilisation und Wildnis hin und herwechseln, da jede Welt nur einen Teil dessen bietet, was sie vom Leben benötigen.</p>\n<p>Falls du einen Charakter spielen möchtest, der völlig von der Norm abweicht und auf der Linie zwischen Zivilisation und Wildnis wandelt, könnte ein Erwecktes Tier geeignet sein.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>zwischen humanoiden Gesellschaften und den Kreaturen der Wildnis vermitteln.</li>\n<li>abwechselnd ins Grübeln verfallen und voller wilder Aggression handeln.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Andere könnten…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>dich für eine leicht zu provozierende Bestie halten.</li>\n<li>dich ohne Respekt für deine Intelligenz oder deine Wünsche und Bedürfnisse studieren wollen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Körperliche Beschreibung</h2>\n<p>Erweckte Tiere ähnelt sehr den Tieren, die sie einst gewesen sind. Für Humanoide fällt es schwer, Erweckte Tiere von normalen Artgenossen zu unterscheiden, bis sie sich sich näher ansehen – dann fällt ihnen etwas Seltsames an den Augen und Bewegungen des Erweckten Tieres auf. Dem Erweckten Tier kann man ansehen, dass sich seiner selbst bewusst ist, so dass auch jene einen Unterschied bemerken, die nicht wissen, dass es erweckt wurde. Sobald ein Erwecktes Tier anfängt, Kleidung und anderen Schmuck zu tragen und Werkzeuge zu benutzen, liegt natürlich klar auf der Hand, dass man es nicht mehr mit einem normalen Tier zu tun hat.</p>\n<p>Andere Tier erkennen Erweckte Tiere sofort und reagieren zunächst mit Vorsicht. Wird das Tier willkommen geheißen, beruhigt es sich und nähert sich dem Erweckten Tier. Tiere brauchen allerdings lange, bis sie sich in Gegenwart erweckter Artgenossen wohlfühlen.</p>\n<p>Traumatische Erweckungsprozesse erzeugen zuweilen überraschende visuelle Veränderungen – man erzählt sich von Erweckten Bären mit flammenrotem Fell und Vögeln mit geisterhaften Federn.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Erweckte Tiere sind so selten und weitläufig über die Welt verstreut, dass nur in wenigen Fällen zwei oder drei zusammen reisen – was das Entstehen eigener Gesellschaften eigentlich ausschließt. Oft versuchen sie, sich in nahe Gesellschaften zu integrieren, teils indem sie sich als „normale“ Tiere verkleiden, teils indem sie gleich als Arbeiter und Handwerker ihre Dienste feilbieten. Diese Erweckten Tiere können sich meistens rasch anpassen. Auf Golarion hat man an den meisten Orten schon genug gesehen, dass die Überraschung über eine sprechende Hauskatze oder einen plappernden Singvogel schnell abklingt.</p>\n<p>Natürlich könnte ein Erwecktes Tier für sich auch entscheiden, dass die humanoide Gesellschaft nichts für es ist. Jene, die sich vom „zivilisierten“ Leben abwenden, neigen zum Erschaffen tierischer Gesellschaften mit sich selbst an der Spitze. Sie nutzen ihre Intelligenz, um Ordnung und Strukturen zu erschaffen, zu denen ihre Artgenossen normalerweise nicht fähig sind. In Ustalav kursieren Geschichten über ein großes Wolfsrudel, welches sich aus mehreren kleinen Rudeln zusammensetzt und von einem Erweckten Wolf angeführt wird. Dieses Rudel streift durchs Land und schützt die Dörfer vor Untoten. In Isger berichten Händler von Bären, die Handelszüge angreifen, aber nur so viel Schaden anrichten, bis sie die Waren stehlen und sich wieder absetzen können.</p>\n<p>Angeblich gibt es in Iobaria eine Stadt voller Erweckter Tiere namens Roam, von der die meisten Erweckten Tiere im Laufe ihrer Leben hören. Manche halten es für ein substanzloses, wenn auch schönes Gerücht, andere machen sich auf die Suche nach Roam. Angeblich ist es die wahre Heimat aller Erweckter Tiere, wo ihr Intellekt und wilder Geist in gleichem Maße willkommen sind.</p>\n<p>Da Tiere zum Identifizieren anderer statt Namen ihre Sinne nutzen, spiegelt sich dies meistens wider, wenn Erweckte Tiere Dinge (und sich selbst) Namen geben. Sie könnten Freunden Spitznamen verleihen, die zu Sinnesinformationen und mit ihnen verbundenen Gefühlen passen. Dies gilt auch für sie selbst, außer sie nutzen weiterhin Namen, die sie als Haustiere oder Gefährten erhalten haben, oder falls sie die Namenskonventionen der Gesellschaft nutzen, in der sie sich bewegen. Manchmal verbinden sie den instinktbasierenden Ansatz auch mit einem konventionelleren Namen, um etwas Stolzes und Bombastisches zu erschaffen.</p>\n<h3>Beispielnamen</h3>\n<p>Brummel, Funkelmund, Gelbschnabel, Grinsemaul, Großklaue, Knurrauge, König Halbhorn, Königin Schuppe, Rotfell, Schwarznase.</p>\n<h2>Glauben und Religion</h2>\n<p>Erweckte Tiere betrachten die Welt in der Welt durch die Brille der natürlichen Ordnung. Jene, die sich in Gegenwart von Menschen unwohl fühlen oder durch sie traumatisiert wurden, leben in der Regel in der Natur, während die, die von Neugier angetrieben werden oder Strukturen suchen, sich einen Platz in der geordneteren und regelgebundenen humanoiden Gesellschaft suchen.</p>\n<p>Erweckte Tiere besitzen keine allgemeine Religion, jedoch dürfte es nicht überraschen, dass sie sich von Gottheiten angesprochen fühlen, die die Natur in ihrem Portfolio haben – z.B. Gozreh. Es gibt kleine Gruppe Erweckter Tiere, die destruktive Götter wie Lamaschtu oder Rovagug verehren. Wer von einem Gefährten erweckt wurde, könnte dessen Blickwinkel und sogar seine Religion übernehmen</p>\n<p><strong>Verbreitete Gebote</strong> Erkunde deine neugefundene Intelligenz, erfreue dich an den Annehmlichkeiten der humanoiden Zivilisation; oft kommen noch kreaturenspezifische Gebote deiner tierhaften Seite dazu, z.W. „Halte das Rudel zusammen“ im Fall eines Wolfes oder Hundes oder „Wasche stets deine Nahrung“ im Fall eines Waschbären</p>\n<p><strong>Verbreitete Anathemata</strong> Kehre wieder zu rein animalischen Verhaltensweisen zurück.</p>\n<h2>Spielmechanik</h2>\n<p><strong>Seltenheit</strong> Selten</p>\n<p><strong>Trefferpunkte</strong> Die durch deine Abstammung erlangten Trefferpunkte hängen davon ab, welche Größenkategorie du wählst (siehe unten).

          "name": "Azarketi",
          "text": "<p>Azarketis, inheritors of a shattered empire's legacy, hold their proud traditions close but still surface to interact with the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>The aquatic humanoids of the Inner Sea share a somber and burdened history. Most refer to these aquatic peoples as gillmen or sometimes Low Azlanti, though they typically refer to themselves as azarketi, an Azlanti word that translates roughly to \"people of the seas.\" After Earthfall, these proud humans were mutated into aquatic servants by their alghollthu foes. Feeling like they don't fully belong with their human brethren nor with the sea that binds them, many azarketis struggle for a sense of identity and purpose. Though they remain distrusted by the surface dwellers, azarketis celebrate their unique lineage and their descent from the venerated Azlanti culture.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ambitiously seek to defy negative perceptions and prejudice laid against you.</li>\n<li>Be reclusive and skeptical of strangers.</li>\n<li>Regard the water as your home, but be intrigued by societies along the shore.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you are an ambassador to the sea and ask for your advice on nautical matters.</li>\n<li>Misunderstand your gentle gestures and mild expressions.</li>\n<li>Treat you with distrust or suspicion and anticipate betrayal from you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Azarketis appear as regal, athletic humans. Their soft, hydrophilic skin ranges in tones from pearlescent white to pinkish, greenish, or brown tones reminiscent of coral. Azarketis with hair are somewhat rare; many sport fins or scaled ridges on their heads instead. Like the Azlanti people from which they descend, they often have violet eyes. Their aquatic lineage is obvious thanks to the sets of three gills on either side of their necks, as well as their webbed hands and feet. Azarketis have been known to live longer than humans, although they mature at about the same rate.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Azarketis lack the center for combined culture that helps other groups maintain a cohesive identity. The vastness of the oceans and waterways spread these swift-swimming people across the Inner Sea and beyond. Many azarketis rely only on the small familial groups in their immediate community and prefer smaller populations with comrades they trust and know intimately.</p>\n<p>Some azarketis prefer to foster connections with their surface-dwelling brethren. Living in ports, river towns and along the shore allows azarketis a greater scope of opportunities not afforded to exclusively land or sea peoples. Although integrating with land society can be difficult, azarketis manage by forming bonded communities. Members will often have fond familial names for one another, regardless of actual relation.</p>\n<p>If they have the means, some azarketis dress in attire reflecting their Azlanti heritage. More commonly, azarketis do their best to remain inconspicuous when they emerge from the water. Many will wear shemaghs or other head wrappings, which both hide their gills and provide a few extra comfortable hours out of water if soaked before donning.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>As they are typically outsiders to the domains of surface life, azarketis tend toward deities with an affinity for the ocean or other forms of water, the most popular being Gozreh. They are also likely to give reverence to other deities of nature or navigation, such as Desna.</p>\n<p>Some azarketis are tempted toward the call of the deep and serve their old alghollthu masters as gods. These individuals are enticed by eldritch entities such as the mysterious veiled masters—powerful beings of the deep ocean responsible for both uplifting and destroying the Azlanti people.</p>\n<p>Azarketis vary wildly in beliefs and values, as evidenced by their broad divergence in allegiance; thus, azarketis can be of any alignment.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Azarketis often take the names of nautical, weather, or geographical features important to the azarketi's family. Other azarketi groups will choose human names in order to encourage conformity with surface cultures. Some azarketi names have been passed down through so many generations that they still use ancient Azlanti roots or refer to bodies of water that no longer exist.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Aft, Aliz, Cascade, Delta, Harbor, Ilani, Inkua, Jib, Lagoon, Lobay, Marine, Tidal, Windward, Zarket</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Azarketi Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet, Swim 30 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Alghollthu</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

After the first 24 hours outside of water, you take a -1 status penalty to Fortitude saves.

          "text": "<p>Zentauren sind stolze Nomaden, welche ihre Stammesgebiete durchstreifen und ihre Länder gegen Eindringlinge und vor Ausbeutung beschützen. Sie sind Überlebensspezialisten, die enge Bindungen zu Familien- und Gemeinschaftsangehörige schmieden und standhaft im Angesicht jedweder Gefahr sind. Viele sind fähige Jäger, Spurensucher und Krieger, die mit Bogen, Stahl und Hufen kämpfen. Sie sind tapfer, stur und willens, sich selbst den zähesten Gegnern und größten Armeen entgegenzustellen, um Heim, Artgenossen und Stammesgebiet zu verteidigen.</p>\n<p>Als Jäger und Sammler sind Zentauren zum Überleben von den Früchten der Natur abhängig. Junge Zentauren lernen, ihre Leben lang die umliegenden Ökosysteme zu hegen und zu respektieren und für künftige Generationen zu erhalten. Zentauren wissen, dass ein ausgeplündertes oder geschändetes Land kein Land ist, in dem man auf Dauer überleben kann, ganz wie eine Herde ausstirbt, wenn zu viele ihrer Angehörigen von Jägern erlegt werden. In der fernen Vergangenheit hat solche Sorglosigkeit und Gier zu Hungersnöten, Anfälligkeit für Seuchen und Gebietsverlusten geführt, so dass die meisten Zentauren sehr darauf achten, die Fehler ihrer Vorfahren nicht zu wiederholen. Entsprechend passen sie sich lieber ihrer Umgebung an, statt sie zur eigenen Annehmlichkeit zu missbrauchen. Sie sind Hüter der Natur und ihre Ansichten führen zu Zusammenstößen und Kämpfen mit sorglosen Städtern und Expansionisten, deren Praktiken das Land ausbeuten und gefährden – solche Leute jagen in einem Gebiet, bis nichts mehr lebt, holzen den Wald ab, bis er sich nicht mehr aus eigener Kraft erholen kann, verschmutzen die Natur und ersticken sie unter ihren Städten.</p>\n<p>Zentauren sind am glücklichsten, wenn sie sich frei umherbewegen können, und viele sind ruhelos oder werden sogar krank, wenn sie eingepfercht werden oder zu lange sesshaft sind. Sie lieben es zu rennen und sich athletisch zu betätigen. Sie sind aggressiv kompetitiv und streben danach sich selbst und andere zu übertreffen. Außenstehende halten Zentauren daher oft für streitlustig und rüpelhaft. Die meisten Zentauren mögen körperliche Wettbewerbe, insbesondere Teamsportarten, und belohnen die Sieger mit kleinen, aber hochgeschätzten Erinnerungstrophäen. Für die meisten Zentauren ist der größte Preis aber das Recht, mit dem Sieg angeben zu können. Nicht alle treten als Athleten an, aber die meisten betätigen sich gern körperlich und widmen sich Aktivitäten, die ihr Blut in Wallung und das Herz zum Rasen bringen.</p>\n<p>Falls du einen Charakter spielen möchtest, der stolz und frei durch die Natur eilt und stets auf seine Gefährten aufpasst, solltest du einen Zentauren in Erwägung zu ziehen.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest...</h2><ul>\n<li>alles tun, um dein Heim und dir wichtige Leute zu beschützen.</li>\n<li>Wettkämpfe lieben, insbesondere organisierte Sportarten und Prüfungen deiner Stärke oder Ausdauer.</li>\n<li>die Natur respektieren und schätzen.</li>\n</ul><h2>Andere könnten...</h2><ul>\n<li>dich für einen Meisterschützen oder versierten Krieger halten.</li>\n<li>glauben, du hättest Ahnung von Pferden und würdest vielleicht sogar ihre Sprache sprechen.</li>\n<li>dich für aggressiv und zu wettbewerbslustig halten.</li>\n</ul><h2>Körperliche Beschreibung</h2>\n<p>Zentauren haben die Gestalt muskulöser Menschen mit Pferdeleibern von der Hüfte abwärts. Sie sind zäh und standfest und imstande, schwere und unhandliche Lasten über längere Zeit hinweg zu tragen. Unter Zentauren gibt es große Unterschiede, was Größe, Haarfarbe und Färbung angeht. Die meisten sind im Schnitt 2,10 m groß und wiegen über 2.000 Pfund. Die Färbung wird oft vererbt, aber die Zeichnungen sind unberechenbar, daher sind viele stolz auf ihre Muster, wo diese liegen und wie sich die Farben verschieben. Diese Zeichnungen sind von Geburt an vorhanden und verändern sich im Laufe des Lebens nicht. In vergangenen Zeiten wurde anhand seiner Muster die Zukunft des fraglichen Zentauren vorhergesagt. Diese Tradition wird zwar seit dem Tod der Prophezeiung nicht mehr groß genutzt, dennoch werden besonders seltene Zeichnungen auch heute noch als glücks- oder unglückbringend angesehen.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Zentauren stammen ursprünglich vom Kontinent Casmaron. Die meisten leben dort noch immer, insbesondere in Iblydos und Iobaria. In Iblydos sind viele Zentauren Bauern und Gärtner, die sich sorgfältig um Felder und Gärten kümmern; ihr Augenmerk gilt hauptsächlich Wildblumen, Oliven, Feigen und Trauben, aus denen sie einen starken und beliebten Wein herstellen. Dank im Volk beliebter Erzählungen über die fast schon mythischen Zentauren Elthavus und Ventriadi, die die Mentoren zahlreicher iblydaner Heldengötter der Antike gewesen sind, glaubt man gemeinhin, dass Zentauren die idealen Ausbilder von Helden seien. Die Zentauren selbst tun nichts, um diese Annahme zu widerlegen. Die meisten sind tatsächlich fähige Mentoren und alternde Militärkommandeure, Heiler, Astronomen, Baumeister und andere Experten geben oft nur zu gern ihr Wissen an jüngere Generationen weiter. Dank ihres wettbewerbsorientierten Wesens liegen manche zentaurischen Lehrer sogar untereinander im Wettstreit, wer die vielversprechendsten Schüler, Soldaten und Intellektuellen ausbilden kann!</p>\n<p>Im Laufe der Zeitalter haben sich die Zentauren hauptsächlich von Iobaria über den Gutteil der Region der Inneren See ausgebreitet. Eine größere Population gibt es auf der Insel Kortos, wo man schon lange Groll gegen die Bürger Absaloms hegt und einen Guerillakrieg gegen die ständigen Eindringlinge ins Stammesterritorium führt. Neben Menschen bekämpft man aber auch die Harpyien und Minotauren der Nachbarschaft. Die Zentauren streifen hier durch die Tieflande und Wälder, den Immenwald und bis zu alpinen Wiesen hinauf.</p>\n<p>Zentauren ziehen als Nomaden durch ihre großen Stammesgebiete und leben als mobile Gemeinschaften aus Jägern und Sammlern. Die Territorien sind gutabgesteckt und werden von ihnen seit Generationen gepflegt. Im Herzen des Territorium liegt eine zentrale Stätte von Bedeutung für den Stamm. Oftmals ist es eine religiöse Stätte, ein Treffpunkt oder ein Lager für die Kranken und Alten, die nicht mehr mit dem restlichen Stamm reisen können. Einige dieser Lager haben sich zu dauerhaften Niederlassungen in Abhängigkeit von der Umgebung und dem verfügbaren Baumaterial aus Holz, Kalkstein, Lehmziegeln oder gar Marmor weiterentwickelt. Um diese Dörfer liegen sorgfältig bestellte Felder oder grasen Hühner, Ziegen oder Schafe. Zentauren mögen Tiere, halten sich aber nur selten Haustiere und können mit Pferden gar nichts anfangen.</p>\n<p>Eine Gruppe Zentauren ist eine eng zusammenhaltende Gemeinschaft, die von einem respektierten Mitglied angeführt wird. Dieses hat sich unter Druck als fähig, weise und ruhig erwiesen. In der Regel ist ein Anführer wenigstens im mittleren Alter, da Zentauren Lebenserfahrung als erforderliche Eigenschaft bei einem Anführer erachten. Nur selten entscheidet sich ein Zentaur oder gar eine ganze Gruppe, sich in eine größere Nation zu integrieren oder gar sesshaft zu werden. Meist gehen kleine Gruppen diesen Weg, deren Stammesgebiete zerstört oder gestohlen wurden. Aber vielleicht sind es auch Gesandte, die ihre Stämme repräsentieren, Abenteurer, Einzelgänger, Ausgestoßene oder auch Gruppen, die einfach vor einem überlegenen militärischen Feind weichen. In keinem Fall wird die Wahl leichtfertig getroffen, da die meisten Zentauren sich in urbanen Umgebungen eingepfercht fühlen, insbesondere wenn die Gebäude für Leute von kleinerer Durchschnittgröße errichtet wurden.</p>\n<p>Wenn Zentauren Gebäude errichten, so sind diese groß und luftig, damit man sich darin auch bewegen kann. Diese Bauwerke stehen allen offen, liegen stets oberirdisch und sind teilweise den Elementen hin geöffnet – breite Türen sind offen festgekeilt oder im Dach oder den Wänden gibt es Öffnungen, um Licht hineinzulassen. Als Materialien dienen in der Regel Holz, Stroh und Lehmziegel, wobei in Iblydos härtere Materialien wie Marmor und Stein eher genommen werden. In Iobaria nutzt man dagegen oft alte Ruinen der Zyklopen, welche genug Raum bieten.</p>\n<p>Die iobarischen Zentauren schätzen allgemein Kräuterkunde, Heilkunde und Fä- higkeiten zum Durchführen magischer Reinigungstechniken, da in dieser Region immer wieder Seuchen und Krankheiten ausbrechen. Kaum eine Zentaurengruppe reist ohne fähige Heiler und selbst Jagd- und Spähtrupps lösen sich nur selten länger vom Rest des Stammes. Die Heiler und Kräuterkundigen der Zentauren legen meistens ihre Streitigkeiten und Animositäten untereinander beiseite und kommen jährlich zusammen, um Wissen auszutauschen, egal welchem Stamm oder welcher Gruppe der einzelne angehört. Dort tauschen Repräsentanten aller möglichen Stämme medizinische Errungenschaften und andere Informationen aus. Die größten dieser Zusammenkünfte erfolgen alle zwei Jahre in Vuinirn der größten zentaurischen Ansiedlung von Iobaria.</p>\n<p>In Kaer Maga, Cheliax, Molthune und Oprak haben sich Zentauren bereits in die jeweiligen Lande integriert. Zuweilen leben sie als normale Bürger und Händler, weitaus mehr arbeiten aber als Soldaten und Söldner. In Garund streifen Zentauren über Ebenen und die Savanne. Sie kommen gut mit anderen Kulturen zurecht, die die Natur respektieren, und tun sich mit Amurruni, Tripkies, Elfen und Orks zusammen, um am Ocotasee Dämonen zu bekämpfen, Untote nahe den Grenzen von Geb und Mzali und andere gefährliche Bedrohungen. Zu Taldor und Andoran pflegen sie offene Feindschaft, da sie sich noch bestens an die alten Kriege erinnern, in deren Rahmen das expansionswütige Taldor sie aus dem Verdurawald vertrieben hat. In diesen Regionen träumen viele davon, die alten Stammesgebiete zurückzuerobern – ein gefährlicher Traum, der zum Tod zahlloser Zentauren führen könnte.</p>\n<p>Zentauren glauben an die Möglichkeit der Reformierung und verlassen sich oft auf den Druck der Gemeinschaft, um anderen schädliches Verhalten auszureden. Wer keine Buße für Untaten tut, sowie die größten Übeltäter, werden aus dem Stammesterritorium verbannt. Zentauren tun ihr Möglichstes, Artgenossen nicht zu töten, solange man nicht im Krieg befindet oder es sich in der Hitze eines Kampfes nicht vermeiden lässt. Selbst Zentauren, die Dämonen und anderen finsteren Mächten dienen, halten sich daran, auch wenn dies sie nicht daran hindert, andere Zentauren anzugreifen und ihnen nachzustellen, wobei sie aber meistens anderen Gegnern den Vorzug geben.</p>\n<p>Sättel und Zaumzeug sind für Zentauren zugleich einschränkend und beschämend, als würde man sie in Ketten legen und in Käfige sperren. Sie hassen es, von anderen geritten zu werden und dienen nur in den größten Notfällen als Reittiere oder tragen bestenfalls jene ihrer Gefährten, denen sie am meisten vertrauen.</p>\n<p>Ein Zentaur besitzt nur einen einzigen Namen, kann sich aber zuweilen eine Bezeichnung durch Taten, Aussehen oder Wesenszüge verdienen, z.B. Donnerruf oder Windläufer. Jenseits ihrer Stammesgrenzen nutzen Zentauren als zusätzliche Identifikation den Stammesnamen. Zentauren, die sich in anderen Ländern niederlassen, übernehmen entweder die Namen ihrer Stämme als Nachnamen oder legen sich eigene Nachnamen zu und gründen so Familien, die die Nachnamen über Generationen weitergeben.</p>\n<h3>Beispielnamen</h3>\n<p>Aecora, Demeleon, Ertris, Hycanthe, Irdan, Jalvayne, Karala, Malion, Oridius, Tolron, Vorag</p>\n<h2>Glauben und Religion</h2>\n<p>Der Glauben eines Zentauren hängt oft davon ab, wo und wie er aufgewachsen ist. Viele folgen dem Grünen Glauben oder verehren Gottheiten, die wie sie die Natur respektieren, z.B. Cernunnos, Erastil oder Gozreh. Andere folgen Desna, der Göttin des Reisens und der Reisenden. Heiler und Kräuterkundler bevorzugen Immonhiel oder Pharasma. In städtischen Bereichen zählen Kurgess und Gorum je nach Temperament und Beruf eines Zentauren zu den Favoriten.</p>\n<p>Bei Zentauren gibt es zwei primäre religiöse Charaktere: Grünsprecher und Glaubenssprecher. Grünsprecher sind eins mit der Natur, außergewöhnliche Kräuterkundige und Kundige der Natur. Glaubenssprecher sind gläubige Anhänger von Göttern, Dämonen, Celestischen und anderen Wesen. Beiden wird dasselbe Maß an Respekt bezeugt, da man sie für zwei Seiten derselben Münze hält. Durch ihre Sprecher interagieren Zentauren mit der Welt jenseits des Sicht- und Fühlbaren. Die Sprecher leiten Zeremonien, Feierlichkeiten und Gebete an. Feierlichkeiten kann man in der Regel in zwei Kategorien unterteilen: Anfänge und Enden. Anfänge umfassen Dinge wie Hochzeiten, Geburten und Frühlingsfeiern und beginnen mit dem Sonnenaufgang, während Enden z.B. Begräbnisse, Trennungen und Herbstfeiern umfassen. Bestattungsriten variieren nach Region und Kultur. Sesshafte Stämme und Ackerbauern unter den Zentauren verbrennen ihre Toten oft und setzen so ihre Seelen frei, während die Asche als Dünger genutzt wird, so dass die Toten weiterhin der Gemeinschaft dienen und wieder Teil der Natur werden können. In felsigen oder eisigen Regionen bestatten Zentauren ihre Toten stattdessen in Grabhügeln oder bedecken sie mit Steinen, bis kleine Hügel in der Landschaft entstehen.</p>\n<p><strong>Verbreitete Gebote</strong> Sorge für die Weitergabe von Wissen, lebe in Harmonie mit der Natur, verhalte dich bei ehrlichen Wettbewerben fair</p>\n<p><strong>Verbreitete Anathemata</strong> Bleib nicht zu lange auf einem Fleck, hilf nie bei vorsätzlicher Zerstörung der Natur</p>\n<h2>Spielmechanik</h2>\n<p><strong>Seltenheit</strong> Ungewöhnlich</p>\n<p><strong>Trefferpunkte</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Größenkategorie</strong> Groß</p>\n<p><strong>Bewegungsrate</strong> 30 Fuß/9 m</p>\n<p><strong>Attributsverstärkungen</strong> Stärke, Weisheit, Frei</p>\n<p><strong>Attributsschwäche</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Sprachen</strong> Gemeinsprache, Feeisch, Weitere Sprachen in Höhe deines Intelligenzbonus.

          "name": "Conrasu",
          "text": "<p><em>Conrasus are shards of cosmic force given consciousness who construct intricate exoskeletons to interface with the mortal world. Both an integral part of the underlying processes of the universe and strangely set apart, conrasus look to aeons to understand their existence.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Conrasus aren't entirely clear on their own origins. Some historians think them a failed experiment of a wizardly cabal—possibly a splinter of artificers from the ancient Jitska Imperium—who desperately hoped to bind a pleroma to bolster their army but who accidentally conjured shattered scraps of the aeon instead. Others believe conrasus were built by their ancestors using an accelerated, iterative evolution process as natural as one designed by those who build portions of their own bodies could ever hope to achieve. Most likely, it is a mix of the two.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Do your best to determine and act upon the will of your guiding aeon.</li>\n<li>Use rituals and repetitive actions as a means to meditate and reflect on your purpose.</li>\n<li>Have difficulty applying your cosmic instincts and senses to a physical existence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>View you as part of a hivemind at best or lacking in free will at worst.</li>\n<li>Have trouble understanding your perspective or attempts at communication.</li>\n<li>Look to you as the expert on any matters involving aeons or related beings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>The true form of a conrasu is an abstract chunk of spiritual essence. While their being exists beyond the truth of humanoid senses, to the mortal eye, their body usually resembles a globe of light, darkness, or space. Floating, internal pinpricks of illumination sit inside the ball, slightly obscured as if peeking through a gelatinous substance. These \"cores\" surround themselves with bodies made out of still-living wood, creating the form that most people recognize as a conrasu.</p>\n<p>Conrasus themselves are called to a path and, once they find it, shape frames to create a suitable form, leading to a wide variety of appearances. As a conrasu ages, the supple green wood of ttheir body hardens, causing their limbs to lose mobility. Conrasus must constantly grow new arms and roots for their living exoskeleton, leaving their frozen limbs as immobile effigies along their shell.</p>\n<p>Conrasus can't maintain their integrity without their wooden exoskeletons. A conrasu that loses its exoskeleton dissipates and dies, though they can be returned to life with magic like other beings.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>There are three distinct types of conrasus. Maintainers tend and care for others, believing they must cultivate a proper balance between various forces. Shapers build and direct those around them, and feel that balance is maintained by those who strive to preserve the world's equilibrium. Lastly, correctors fix problems of all sorts, often acting as stalwart bastions of law who perceive the world in absolutes, with few to no shades of gray. True balance can be achieved only in cases where pressure and force have been applied to make necessary changes.</p>\n<p>On rare occasions, a conrasu may hear and heed the call of another form of extraplanar being. One might serve a psychopomp, another an archon, and yet another might become a witch and adopt an unknown figure as a patron.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Many conrasus consider themselves bound to a specific aeon, following them like a deity and doing what they believe to be the aeon's bidding. As a result, almost all conrasus are lawful neutral in alignment.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Conrasus have little in the way of consciousness as others understand it before they self-actualize and leave the nursery-towns where they sprouted. That includes a name, a concept of gender, and even the passage of time beyond their little bubbles-these are picked up in the wider world. As a result, a conrasu might have nearly any appellation.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Automa, Azubu, Dumi, Emeka, Ganizadi, Locu, Incanes, Radi, Shell, Weave</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Conrasu Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Mwangi, Rasu</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Once a conrasu has recovered Hit Points in this way, they are temporarily immune to further uses of Sunlight Healing for 1 day.</p>\n<h2>Conrasu Heritages</h2>\n<p>As a conrasu grows, they take part in a rite that changes and enhances their form. Each rite has different benefits, which manifest as specific heritages.

Das Vertrauen eines Zwerges muss hart erarbeitet werden - doch dann ist es felsenfest.</p>\n<p>Falls du einen Charakter spielen willst, der hart wie Eisen, zäh wie Leder und ein sturer, unnachgiebiger Abenteurer ist, bei dem sich Abhärtung und tiefgreifende Weisheit - oder zumindest Entschlossenheit - verbinden, solltest du einen Zwerg spielen.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>... danach streben, deine persönliche Ehre in jeder Situation zu wahren.</li>\n<li>... hochwertige Handwerkskunst in allen Formen schätzen und auch für deine Ausrüstung darauf bestehen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Andere könnten...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>... dich für einen Sturkopf halten - ob dies etwas Gutes oder Schlechtes ist, hängt natürlich vom Einzelfall ab.</li>\n<li>... die tiefgreifende Verbindung erkennen, die du zu deiner Familie, deinen Ahnen und deinen Freunden unterhältst.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Körperliche Beschreibung</h2>\n<p>Zwerge sind klein und stämmig und wenigstens 0,30 m kürzer als die meisten Menschen. Sie sind breit und kompakt gebaut.

Ein langer Bart ist unter vielen Zwergensippen ein Zeichen der Ehre und der Männlichkeit.</p>\n<p>Zwerge sind mit etwa 25 Jahren erwachsen, allerdings legt ihre traditionsreiche Kultur mehr Wert auf das Ausführen verschiedener Übergangsrituale, die für jede Sippe einzigartig sind, als auf das Erreichen eines bestimmten Alters. Ein typischer Zwerg kann etwa 350 Jahre alt werden.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>In uralter Zeit herrschten die Zwerge über ein Weltreich an der Oberfläche, allerdings wurde es vor langer Zeit bereits von orkischen und goblinoiden Feinden überrannt. Die heutigen Zwerge besitzen immer noch viele jener Eigenschaften, die ihrem Volk in der Vergangenheit zu Größe verholfen haben: Sturheit, Verbissenheit und Schläue in allen Anstrengungen. Zwerge leben in ihren in die Berge gehauenen Himmelszitadellen. Da diese über die Welt verteilt sind, können zwischen verschiedenen Zwergensippen große kulturelle Unterschiede bestehen. Nahezu alle Zwergenvölker teilen sich aber die Leidenschaft für die Steinbearbeitung, die Metallbearbeitung und ihre Familien.</p>\n<p>Man begegnet kaum einem Zwerg, der nicht seinen Sippendolch am Gürtel trägt. Dieser Dolch wird direkt vor der Geburt eines Zwerges geschmiedet und trägt den Edelstein, der mit seiner Sippe assoziiert wird.

Nachdem sie in uralter Zeit Golarion verlassen hatten, kehrten sie in ein verändertes Land zurück und mühen sich noch immer, ihre einstige Heimat zurückzuerobern. Elfen schätzen Freundlichkeit und Schönheit und streben oft danach, ihre Manieren, ihr Äußeres, ihr Auftreten und ihre Kultur zu verbessern. Sie verschlingen das Wissen oft regelrecht, widmen sich aber den Dingen in einem Detailgrad, der auf die meisten kurzlebigeren Wesen exzessiv oder ineffizient wirkt. Viele Elfen ziehen ihre Privatsphäre vor und tauchen in die Geheimnisse ihrer Haine ein oder bleiben unter sich. Zu Nichtelfen bauen sie nur langsam Freundschaften auf. Elfen, die unter kurzlebigeren Leuten leben, entwickeln oft eine verzerrte Wahrnehmung ihrer eigenen Sterblichkeit und neigen dazu, grimmig und freudlos zu werden, nachdem sie Generationen an Gefährten beim Altern und Sterben zugesehen haben. Diese Elfen werden als die Verlassenen bezeichnet.</p>\n<p>Falls du einen Charakter spielen willst, der magisch, mystisch und mysteriös ist, solltest du einen Elfen spielen.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>... sorgfältig deine Beziehungen zu Leuten mit kürzerer Lebenserwartung pflegen.</li>\n<li>... spezielle oder obskure Interessen übernehmen, nur um sie zu meistern.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Andere könnten...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>... sich auf dein Äußeres konzentrieren, etwa indem sie deine Grazie bewundern oder dich behandeln, als wärst du zerbrechlich.</li>\n<li>... sich sorgen, dass du insgeheim auf sie herabsiehst, oder glauben, du wärst herablassend und distanziert.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Körperliche Beschreibung</h2>\n<p>Elfen sind hochgewachsen und generell größer als Menschen. Sie besitzen eine fragile Eleganz, welche durch lange Gliedmaßen und spitzzulaufende Ohren akzentuiert wird. Ihre Augen sind breit und mandelförmig mit großen und kräftig gefärbten Pupillen, welche den ganzen sichtbaren Teil der Augen einnehmen. Diese Pupillen verleihen ihnen ein fremdartiges Aussehen und lassen sie selbst bei sehr wenig Licht bestens sehen.</p>\n<p>Elfen passen sich nach und nach an ihre Umgebung und ihre Gefährten an und nehmen häufig sogar körperliche Merkmale an, welche ihre Umgebung reflektieren. Ein Elf, der jahrhundertelang in einem Urwald gelebt hat, könnte z.B. grünes Haar und knorrige Finger besitzen, während ein Wüstenbewohner goldene Haut und Pupillen haben könnte. Elfen erreichen körperlich das Erwachsenenalter mit etwa 20 Jahren, werden von anderen Elfen aber erst mit knapp 100 Jahren als emotional gereift betrachtet.

Elfen sind notorisch nachtragend; sie bezeichnen ihre Rivalen als <em>Ilduliel</em>, allerdings können aus solch feindseligen Beziehungen mit der Zeit Freundschaften erwachsen. Ein Elf teilt seinen persönlichen Namen nur mit seiner Familie und nennt Außenstehenden stattdessen einen Spitznamen. Dieser Spitzname kann sich mit der Zeit aufgrund von Geschehnissen im Leben des Elfen oder auch nur aus einer Laune heraus verändern. Unterschiedliche Bekannte verschiedenen Alters aus unterschiedlichen Regionen könnten denselben Elfen unter vielen Namen kennen.

Their bodies are just as diverse in shape and size as humans, though most display a certain fluidity of motion reminiscent of shifting shadows. Fetchlings' reflective, pupilless eyes can pierce darkness. A fetchling's most notable feature is their shadow, which almost never faithfully reflects their body. Instead, fetchling shadows might have incongruous shapes or sizes, while others flicker, move of their own accord, or imitate the shadow of another nearby creature.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Most fetchlings remain close to Golarion on either the Material or Shadow Planes, either forming majority-fetchling communities or forging solitary paths. Both planar groups tend to be insular; many fetchling cultures preserve memories of their early, perilous days confronting the Shadow Plane's hostile or beguiling denizens. Their predilection for forming tight communal bonds and adapting to local customs has spread to become part of broader fetchling culture, reinforced by two major fetchling groups—the Estlaris and Sharedars—who live in the shadow of more powerful entities.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>A culture of survival passed down through generations means many fetchlings prefer to maintain a cautious worldview and adapt to prevailing circumstances. As a result, many trend toward a neutral outlook on life. Some choose to join with local powers for personal or communal advancement, or to tear systems down from the inside. Others attempt to shatter what they see as fetters that bind them and their communities.</p>\n<p>No small number of fetchlings are nonreligious, recognizing all gods' powers but revering none. Faithful fetchlings prefer gods that offer protection and stability, be it the pastoral embrace of Erastil or the binding chains of Zon-Kuthon. Those who travel alone or pass between planes seek the comfort of Alseta, Desna, and Gozreh. Calistria appeals to ambitious fetchlings, while Grandmother Spider and Sivanah help those who wish to move through the world unnoticed or unfettered. Some worship these three as a pantheon called the Laughing Veil; a few even include Norgorber as a fourth member.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Fetchlings adapted to a new world, and their names do the same. These names commonly include phonetic qualities from multiple languages or are simply local cultural names that fetchling families find compelling. Other dominant naming conventions include flowing sounds, harsh or hissing consonants, and surnames that refer to important relatives or community traits.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Amelisce, Ashka, Drosil, Eitsanara, Eomva, Ikyamek, Inva, Jegan, Lirtae, Meotrai, Sorsul, Zokaratz</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Fetchling Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Shadowtongue</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "text": "<p><em>Fleshwarps are people whose forms were created or radically transformed by magic, alchemy, or unnatural energies. Their unorthodox appearance can make it difficult for them to find a place for themselves in the world.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Magic and science that can warp bone and twist sinew are all too common on Golarion. Fleshwarps are those who have been permanently altered by such methods—sometimes a sapient being created whole cloth from inanimate flesh, but often a victim unwillingly transformed by strange energies or sadistic creators.</p>\n<p>The ancestry name \"fleshwarp\" is an umbrella term, since on Golarion the actual fleshwarping process is more infamously well-known than are alterations caused by uncontrolled magic, technology, or fringe science. Whether practiced by Thassilonian wizards, Nexian fleshcrafters, or the drow of the Darklands, fleshwarping is the craft of reshaping flesh and mind in vats of foul magical reagents. This has led some scholars of monsters to argue that only those beings created by traditional fleshwarping should be considered fleshwarps. Regardless of the source of their altered forms, fleshwarps bear their new shape forever, transformed beings living a wild and strange existence beyond what was possible for their original ancestry.</p>\n<p>Although fleshwarps are humanoid, no two look the same. One might possess limbs in unusual places and skin as smooth as glass, while another might have a thick matting of spiny fur. Some might have animalistic features, like a boar snout, scales, or cloven hooves. Others have entirely alien appearances, such as bulging eyes on the backs of their hands. Some may have only subtly uncanny features that differentiate them, such as glowing teeth, smoking eyes, or fingernails made of bone. The only commonality among fleshwarps is their mismatched nature. Let your imagination run wild when creating a fleshwarp character!</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is tough and hardy, can change their form as they grow, and can use their wholly unique appearance to inspire awe or fear in others, you should play a fleshwarp.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Embrace your unusual appearance to inspire respect or fear.</li>\n<li>Be used to relying on yourself.</li>\n<li>Distrust large groups of people, particularly mobs, based on past experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find your physiology fascinating or terrifying.</li>\n<li>Assume you are an expert on strange creatures or occult phenomena.</li>\n<li>Consider you an enigmatic and unpredictable—and perhaps even dangerous—outsider.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Fleshwarps are humanoids, ranging from 5 to 7 feet tall and from just under 100 pounds to more than 300 pounds. The proportion and appearance of their limbs and features differ widely, but fleshwarps functionally have two legs, two arms, and a single head; a fleshwarp with more limbs than this should consider an appropriate ancestry feat to reflect this variance, or one of their limbs might be vestigial and mostly nonfunctional. Fleshwarps differ widely in their appearance due to the unique circumstances of their creation. Even fleshwarp siblings or two people transformed through the same procedure might look wildly different.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Fleshwarps are so few in number that congregations of them are rare. They most often live on their own, with a small family group, or at the outskirts of a community. Some thrive in cities, however, where they can remain anonymous among the crowds while pursuing careers that allow them to avoid contact with people who might fear or persecute them.</p>\n<p>Fleshwarps value endurance and are quick to learn from others, so those who come into contact with others of their kind usually share stories that help each other survive, hide, or thrive more effectively. How a fleshwarp formed can be a painful or horrifying subject, one they consider rude to discuss with anyone besides close friends or loved ones.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Fleshwarps have little to gain from the broader society, and therefore rarely work to support society in turn, beyond perhaps helping other fleshwarps. They need to be able to adapt quickly to survive on their own. As a consequence, few fleshwarps are lawful. Although bigoted or short-sighted people view fleshwarps as monsters, fleshwarps are no more or less prone to evil than any other people, and most seek only to live their lives without trouble. Most are neutral in alignment, for while alienation doesn't force a fleshwarp to feel contempt for others, neither does it encourage a fleshwarp to avoid it. This is especially true for fleshwarps living in the societies that gave birth to their traumatic transformation. Fleshwarps aren't often casually religious; most either have little to do with faith at all (viewing themselves as scorned by the gods or simply seeing faith as impractical for survival) or are exceptionally devout. Religious fleshwarps often revere Arazni, Calistria, Desna, or Gozreh; evil fleshwarps typically turn to Lamashtu, finding consolation in the Mother of Monsters.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Fleshwarps can come from-and thus have names from-any culture or ancestry, but some give themselves new names after being transformed, whether to celebrate the change, recognize a new phase of their lives, or conceal their past identity. Many fleshwarps also carry a descriptive nickname granted to them by others, such as \"Triple Handed,\" \"Barkfoot,\" or \"Many-Mouth.\"</p>\n<p>Fleshwarps don't keep nicknames they find personally offensive, but they tend to keep ones that describe their distinctive appearances or that are given by people they care about.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Borble, Dag, Feff, Hurn, Kemp, Omber, Ostro, Shurni, Surm, Wumpin</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Fleshwarp Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium or Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "name": "Ghoran",
          "text": "<p><em>Diese intelligenten Pflanzenwesen, die von einem bereits lange verstorbenen Druiden erschaffen wurden, besitzen durch ihre Samen eine Art Unsterblichkeit - es sei denn, diese werden durch äußere Einflüsse zerstört, bei denen es sich nicht nur um den Zahn der Zeit handelt.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Vor langer Zeit, auf dem Höhepunkt der Kriege zwischen Geb und Nex, bat der Erzmagier Nex den abtrünnigen Druiden Ghorus, eine Pflanze zu erschaffen, die sein Volk auch im unwirtlichsten Land ernähren würde. Ghorus tat dies und entwickelte eine Blume, die sich an jede Umgebung anpasste und jeder Art von Magie und Zauberei widerstehen konnte. Es gelang ihm zu gut. In der fremden Erde der Unfassbaren Lande wuchs die Blume und begann bald, ein Bewusstsein zu entwickeln - und schließlich zu laufen und zu sprechen. Dies waren die ersten Ghorani. Trotz ihres neuen Bewusstseins stellten die Ghorani fest, dass viele andere Völker unbequeme Wahrheiten zu ignorieren wussten, insbesondere wenn es darum ging, woher ihre nächste Mahlzeit kommen könnte. Nach und nach, Samen für Samen, wuchsen die Ghorani zu humanoiden Wesen heran, in der Hoffnung, durch die Nachahmung des Aussehens von Humanoiden deren Sympathien zu erwecken. Das funktionierte schließlich und die Ghorani erhielten den Status eines offiziellen Bürgers und eines geschützten Volkes in Nex. Dennoch haben die Zeit und der Kampf gegen die Feinde ihren Tribut gefordert, denn die Ghorani-Population ist gering und schrumpft kontinuierlich weiter.</p>\n<p>Jeder Ghoran ist im Grunde ein uralter Lebensfunke, der nach und nach eine Reihe von pflanzenähnlichen Körpern bewohnt. Etwa alle zwanzig Jahre bringt ein Ghoran einen Samen hervor. Sein alter Körper verwelkt, während seine Seele in den Samen eindringt, der dann rasch einen neuen Körper hervorbringt. Dieser Prozess bringt geringfügige Veränderungen der Persönlichkeit und den Verlust einiger weiter zurückliegender Erinnerungen mit sich, sodass jeder neue Ghoran mit seinem Vorgänger verwandt ist, aber dennoch ein anderes Individuum darstellt. Die Kunst, weitere Ghorani zu erschaffen, starb mit dem Druiden Ghorus, sodass sie eine kleine, aber stabile Minderheit in den Unfassbaren Landen existiert, die im Laufe der Jahrhunderte nach und nach schwindet, da einige von ihnen Gewalt und Unglücken zum Opfer fallen.</p>\n<p>Wenn du einen Charakter spielen willst, der eine uralte und außergewöhnliche Seele ist, die versucht, in einer fremdartigen und feindseligen Welt zu überleben und zu gedeihen, solltest du einen Ghoran spielen.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>...beiläufig Ereignisse von vor Tausenden von Jahren erwähnen.</li>\n<li>...tierische Verhaltensweisen als seltsam empfinden.</li>\n<li>...ständig kleine Veränderungen an deinem Körper vornehmen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Andere werden wahrscheinlich...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>...Schwierigkeiten haben, dich wiederzuerkennen, nachdem sie dich eine Zeit lang nicht gesehen haben.</li>\n<li>...entweder eingeschüchtert oder fasziniert sein davon, wie lange du schon lebst und wie viel du weißt.</li>\n<li>...gehört haben, dass du köstlich bist.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physische Eigenschaften</h2>\n<p>Der Körper eines Ghorans ist in Größe und Form grob humanoid, besteht aber größtenteils aus einem faserigen Pflanzenmaterial, das einer holzigen Ranke ähnelt, und hat ein Gesicht, das einer riesigen, bunten Blume gleicht. Die Ghorani besitzen große Kontrolle über die Form und die Struktur ihres Körpers: Mit ein paar Stunden Aufwand kann ein Ghoran größer oder kleiner, langbeiniger oder bauchiger werden. Sie haben den Ruf, köstlich süß und krautig zu schmecken. Die meisten Menschen empfinden diese Eigenschaft lediglich als Kuriosität und versuchen nicht, einen Bissen zu nehmen, aber in der Wildnis werden sie manchmal von Tieren aufgesucht und angegriffen. Obwohl sie lernen können, schwach zu lächeln oder auch herzhaft zu lachen, um sich an andere Völker anzupassen, neigen sie dazu, ihre Emotionen auf andere Art und Weise auszudrücken: Sie flattern mit ihren Gesichtsblättern, um Freude zu zeigen, und geben ein raschelndes Geräusch von sich, wenn sie aufgeregt oder verärgert sind.</p>\n<p>Jeder Ghoran hat einen großen Hohlraum in seinem Rumpf, der einen großen Samen enthält. Wenn der Körper eines Ghorans zu altersschwach wird, um zu funktionieren, überträgt er seine Erinnerungen auf den Samen und pflanzt ihn in die Erde. Innerhalb von ein bis zwei Monaten wächst aus dem Samen ein neuer Ghorankörper und der ursprüngliche Ghoran zerfällt zu einem Haufen träger organischer Materie. Diese merkwürdige Fortpflanzungsmethode macht einen Ghoran verwundbar, weshalb viele Ghorani gegenüber Nichtghoraner nicht darüber sprechen.</p>\n<p>Da Ghorani Pflanzen sind, haben sie kein angeborenes Verständnis von Geschlecht im menschlichen Sinne. Ghorani, die sich in der Gesellschaft anderer Abstammungen wiederfinden, nehmen manchmal eine männlichere oder weiblichere Form an, aber ebenso viele machen sich nicht die Mühe.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Die Ghorani stammen ursprünglich aus Nex und die meisten leben als winzige Minderheit in diesem Land. In den großen Städten haben sie ihre eigenen kleinen Enklaven in Vierteln mit weitläufigen Parks und riesigen Bäumen gebaut, wobei die größte dieser Enklaven in Quantium liegt. Obwohl sie nicht wie die Dryaden über die magische Fähigkeit verfügen, ein extradimensionales Haus in einem Baum zu betreten, leben die Ghorani zwischen den Bäumen und haben ihre Häuser normalerweise in den großen Parks der Stadtviertel. Sie sind äußerst geschickt darin, ihre Behausungen so zu gestalten, dass sie das Leben der örtlichen Flora nicht stören. Besucher einer ghoranischen Enklave bemerken vielleicht zunächst nicht, dass sie ein Haus betreten haben, sondern nehmen an, dass sie sich in einem öffentlichen Erholungsgebiet befinden. Die Ghorani haben in der Regel nichts gegen unerwarteten Besuch, solange die Besucher den Park, ihre Häuser und die Ghorani, denen sie begegnen, respektieren. Die in den Großstädten lebenden Ghorani sind relativ gesellig und akzeptieren andere Volksgruppen; sie sind in der Regel bereit, sich mit anderen auszutauschen, mehr über andere zu erfahren und Handel zu treiben.</p>\n<p>Außerhalb der Städte leben die Ghorani in kleinen, abgelegenen Gemeinden in den Ausläufern der Trümmerberge und in abgelegenen Waldgebieten, wo sie in der Regel sehr viel isolierter leben. Da sie sich gut daran erinnern, dass Ghorus ihre Spezies ursprünglich als Nahrung für die „Tiere“ erschaffen hat, haben sie im Allgemeinen kein großes Interesse daran, andere Abstammungslinien kennen zu lernen. Allerdings verändert sich die Persönlichkeit eines Ghorans mit jeder neuen Inkarnation ein wenig, und manchmal entwickeln sie ein Fernweh, das sie dazu bringt, ihr isoliertes Zuhause zu verlassen und in die weite Welt zu reisen. Oftmals verfügen solche Ghorani über Bruchstücke oder sogar ganze Sammlungen uralter Überlieferungen, die der Außenwelt viele Jahre lang verborgen blieben, sodass ihre Reisen manchmal zu wichtigen neuen Entdeckungen für andere in den Unfassbaren Landen und darüber hinaus führen können.</p>\n<p>Untereinander arbeiten die Ghorani mühelos und instinktiv zusammen, ohne dass sie eine formelle Regierung brauchen. Die Arbeit wird durch einen stillen Konsens verteilt, der sich aus Tausenden von Jahren Erfahrung ergibt - jeder tut das, was er am besten kann, um die notwendigen Aufgaben zu erfüllen. Dieser schweigende Zusammenhalt ist bereits geübt darin, wie man sich anpasst, wenn ein Ghoran erkrankt oder in eine neue Inkarnation wechselt. Das Hinzukommen neuer Ghorani, die von weit her anreisen, oder von Mitgliedern anderer Abstammungen kann diesen natürlichen Rhythmus manchmal durcheinanderbringen. Der Neuankömmling ist eine unbekannte Größe, sodass die gesamte Gemeinschaft die Neuankömmlinge für eine kurze Zeit der Analyse in einem möglicherweise beunruhigenden Ausmaß im Auge behält. Dies geschieht nicht aus Misstrauen oder dem Wunsch nach Böswilligkeit, sondern aus Neugierde und dem Bedürfnis zu verstehen, was die Neuankömmlinge gut können und wo sie Unterstützung brauchen. Sobald die ghoranische Gemeinschaft eine Schlussfolgerung gezogen hat, passt sie ihre Handlungen entsprechend an - jeder beginnt einfach, seine Aufgaben anders zu erledigen, damit die Neuankömmlinge sich einfügen und ihren Beitrag leisten können, ohne dass es eine offizielle Sitzung oder Erklärung gibt. In den meisten Fällen erkennt eines der Mitglieder der Gemeinschaft, dass sie den nichtghoranischen Neuankömmlingen mitteilen sollten, was die Gemeinschaft von ihnen erwartet, aber manchmal ist sich niemand darüber im Klaren, dass eine Kommunikation notwendig ist. Wenn dies geschieht, können die ghoranische Gemeinschaft und die Neuankömmlinge über die Handlungen und Entscheidungen des jeweils anderen verwirrt sein, da die Gemeinschaft erwartet, dass die Neuankömmlinge einfach einspringen und den Bedarf decken, während die Neuankömmlinge darauf warten, dass ihnen gesagt wird, was die Gemeinschaft von ihnen erwartet.</p>\n<p>Ghoranische Gemeinschaften, die auf diesem uralten Konsens beruhen, haben im Allgemeinen nichts, was einer Führung ähnelt. Dennoch ernennt eine Gemeinschaft manchmal einen einzelnen Ghoran zum Abgesandten für Außenstehende und gibt ihm sogar einen Titel, damit sich die „Tiere“ wohler fühlen, wenn sie eine Nachricht von der gesamten Gemeinschaft erhalten.</p>\n<h2>Gesinnung und Religion</h2>\n<p>Ghorani haben in der Regel keine treibenden Motive, die sie zum Guten oder zum Bösen führen, obwohl ihre pflanzlichen Werte sie manchmal für diejenigen, die nicht ebenfalls pflanzlich sind, als amoralisch erscheinen lassen können. Sie haben einen leichten Hang zur Rechtschaffenheit, besonders in ihren eigenen Gemeinschaften.</p>\n<p>Während die meisten Ghorani nicht besonders religiös sind, neigen spirituell orientierte Ghorani dazu, die Natur mittels des Grünen Glaubens oder - wenn auch seltener - Gozreh oder einen der Ältesten (wie die pflanzenartige Grüne Mutter) zu verehren. Sie interessieren sich selten für menschenbezogene Gottheiten, da Ghorani deutlich andere Denkprozesse und Prioritäten haben. Der Glaube ist eine Angelegenheit, die sich in der Regel von Same zu Same und von Inkarnation zu Inkarnation kaum ändert, was bedeutet, dass die neueren Gottheiten, vor allem jene, die in den letzten Jahrtausenden aufgestiegen sind (aus ghoranischer Sicht „vor Kurzem“), in den ghoranischen Gemeinschaften kaum Fuß fassen können.</p>\n<h2>Namen</h2>\n<p>Die meisten Ghorani wählen bei jeder Inkarnation einen neuen Namen, meist einen Namen oder ein Konzept, das ihnen in einem früheren Leben gefallen hat. Gelegentlich verwendet ein Ghoran einen Namen für mehrere Inkarnationen hintereinander, vor allem wenn er in einer Gemeinschaft anderer Völker verbleibt, obwohl jede Inkarnation immer noch eine eigenständige Person ist.</p>\n<h3>Namensbeispiele</h3>\n<p>Amsalu, Esche, Emnet, Sieri, Ooniel, Arshmarish, Velt, Delphinium, Hach, Smaragd, Säbel</p>\n<h2>Ghoranische Herkünfte</h2>\n<p>Ghorani wurden mit dem ausdrücklichen Ziel erschaffen, sich an ihre Umwelt anzupassen, wodurch sie mehrere verschiedene körperliche Erscheinungsformen aufweisen.

          "name": "Gnom",
          "text": "<p>Long ago, early gnome ancestors emigrated from the First World, realm of the fey. While it's unclear why the first gnomes wandered to Golarion, this lineage manifests in modern gnomes as bizarre reasoning, eccentricity, obsessive tendencies, and what some see as naivete. Always hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people. This affliction, known as the Bleaching, strikes gnomes who fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences. The Bleaching slowly drains the color—literally—from gnomes, and it plunges those affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives. Very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings.</p>\n<p>If you want a character with boundless enthusiasm and an alien, fey outlook on morality and life, you should play a gnome.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Embrace learning and hop from one area of study to another without warning.</li>\n<li>Speak, think, and move quickly, and lose patience with those who can't keep up.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your enthusiasm and the energy with which you approach new situations.</li>\n<li>Struggle to understand your motivations or adapt to your rapid changes of direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Most gnomes stand just over 3 feet in height and weigh little more than a human child. They exhibit a wide range of natural skin, hair, and eye colors. For gnomes that haven't begun the Bleaching, nearly any hair and eye color other than white is possible, with vibrant colors most frequent, while skin tones span a slightly narrower spectrum and tend toward earthy tones and pinkish hues, though occasionally green, black, or pale blue.</p>\n<p>Gnomes typically reach physical maturity at the age of 18, though many gnomes maintain a childlike curiosity about the world even into adulthood. A gnome can theoretically live to any age if they can stave off the Bleaching indefinitely, but in practice gnomes rarely live longer than around 400 years.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>While most gnomes adopt some of the cultural practices of the region in which they live, they tend to pick and choose, adjusting their communities to fit their own fey logic. This often leads to majority gnome communities eventually consisting almost entirely of gnomes, as other people, bewildered by gnomish political decisions, choose to move elsewhere. Gnomes have little culture that they would consider entirely their own. Exceptionally few gnome kingdoms or nations exist on the surface of Golarion, and most gnomes wouldn't know what to do with such a state if they had one.</p>\n<p>By necessity, few gnomes marry for life, instead allowing relationships to run their course before amicably moving on, the better to stave off the Bleaching with new experiences. Though gnome families tend to be small, many gnome communities raise children communally, with fluid family boundaries. Gnome names can get quite complex and polysyllabic. Gnomes rarely concern themselves with how easy their names are to pronounce, and they often go by shorter nicknames. Among gnomes, the shorter the name, the more feminine it's considered to be.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Abroshtor, Bastargre, Besh, Fijit, Halungalom, Krolmnite, Neji, Majet, Pai, Poshment, Queck, Trig, Zarzuket, Zatqualmie</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Though gnomes are impulsive tricksters with inscrutable motives and confusing methods, many at least attempt to make the world a better place.

Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin, and it's been only in recent years that such a partnership has even been an option. Goblins keep their names simple. A good name should be easy to pronounce, short enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say. The namer often picks a word that rhymes with something they like so that writing songs is easier.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Ak, Bokker, Frum, Guzmuk, Krobby, Loohi, Mazmord, Neeka, Omgot, Ranzak, Rickle, Tup, Wakla, Yonk, Zibini</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Even the most well-intentioned goblins have trouble following the rules, meaning goblin adventurers are often unsure whether they're on the right side of the law. Organized worship likewise confounds goblins, and most of them would rather pick their own deities, choosing powerful monsters, natural wonders, or anything else they find fascinating—sometimes even attributing deific status to fellow goblins of note. Goblins who spend time around people of other ancestries might adopt some of their beliefs, though, and many goblin adventurers adopt the worship of Cayden Cailean.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>invent songs for every occasion, turn trash into your treasures, solve problems with fire</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>trust a dog or horse, learn to read</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Goblin Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Goblin</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Da sie nur selten überhaupt gesehen und zudem meist missverstanden werden, flößt das vieläugige und starre Antlitz eines Golomas den meisten, denen sie begegnen, Angst und Schrecken ein.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Zwar können Golomas genauso gefährlich wie andere intelligente Kreaturen auf Golarion sein, in der Psyche dieser Wesen scheint jedoch die Vorstellung tief verwurzelt zu sein, dass sie selbst Beutetiere und alle zweiäugigen Völker gierige Raubtiere sind. Daraus folgt, dass Golomas sich selten anderen zeigen; wenn sie es doch tun, dann nehmen sie häufig bedrohliche Rollen an, um sich selbst zu schützen. Selbst die wenigen Golomas, die sich in die Gesellschaft des Mwangibeckens vorwagen, haben Schwierigkeiten, mit Kreaturen anderer Abstammungen umzugehen, weil sich ihre Wahrnehmung und ihre Gedankengänge so stark von diesen unterscheiden.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>instinktiv große Mengen verschiedener Informationen schnell und effizient verarbeiten.</li>\n<li>Eine Atmosphäre der Einschüchterung verbreiten, um die eigene Nervosität zu verschleiern.</li>\n<li>Schwierigkeiten haben, einzelne Gegenstände oder Personen zu unterscheiden, wenn sie einander ähnlich sind.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Andere könnten...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>sich aufgrund deiner fremdartigen Gestalt vor dir erschrecken.</li>\n<li>deine Schwierigkeiten, einzelne Personen voneinander zu unterscheiden, als Desinteresse missverstehen.</li>\n<li>von deiner Fähigkeit beeindruckt sein, kleinste Details zu bemerken und schnelle Schlussfolgerungen daraus zu ziehen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Körperliche Beschreibung</h2>\n<p>Golomas sind Humanoide mit einer rauen Haut, deren Farbe von warmem Braun bis ebenholzfarben variiert; allerdings sind ein kränkliches Grau oder weiße Individuen mit Albinismus nicht ungewöhnlich. Ihre Finger und Füße sind mit einer dünnen Schicht aus Chitin überzogen. Das Gesicht eines Goloma ist ein länglicher Keil aus glattem Chitin und ähnelt beinahe einer Maske aus Holz. Aus diesem Gesicht stehen acht gallertartige leuchtende Augen hervor. Der Mund und das Gebiss eines Golomas befindet sich unterhalb ihrer Gesichtsplatte. Oberhalb ihres Chitingesichtes ragt ein knöcherner Kamm heraus. Die Rückseite des Kopfes eines Golomas ist von schwarzem Haar bedeckt, das mit tausenden von kleinen spähenden Augen übersät ist. Diese Augen neigen zum Leuchten und winden sich, wenn sie sich umschauen. Für die meisten ist das ein überaus beunruhigender Anblick.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Eine uralte Erzählung der Golomas berichtet, dass während einer Katastrophe vor langer Zeit Götter und Dämonen aus der Erde hervorbrachen, um die Augen anderer Kreaturen zu stehlen. Nur die Golomas und andere Völker, die sich versteckt hatten, wurden von diesem grausamen Schicksal verschont. Aber kurz danach begannen die nun nur noch zweiäugigen Kreaturen Jagd auf sämtliche Golomas zu machen, weil sie danach trachteten, deren Augen zu stehlen, um das zu ersetzen, was ihnen auf gewaltsame Weise genommen wurde. Diese Geschichte - ob nun wahr oder nicht - beschreibt treffsicher die Mentalität der Golomas: Wer sich zeigt ist verwundbar und einem Fremden zu vertrauen ist tödlich. Golomas reisen und leben daher normalerweise in Gruppen mit anderen Golomas zusammen, da dies die Umgebung ist, in der sie sich am wohlsten fühlen.</p>\n<p>Golomas lernen schon in jungen Jahren, zu jeder Zeit wachsam zu sein, die Umgebung auf Unregelmäßigkeiten zu beobachten und dann mit schnellem, berechnendem Instinkt zu reagieren, statt lange über ihre Handlungen nachzudenken. Andere Abstammungen nehmen Golomas häufig als paranoid und übertrieben wachsam wahr. Golomas sind außerdem besser bei der oberflächlichen Beobachtung bestimmter Dinge. Sie können beispielsweise sehr einfach Gemeinsamkeiten in verschiedensten Feldern bemerken, haben aber Probleme, sich daran zu erinnern, wie ein bestimmter Gegenstand oder eine bestimmte Person genau ausgesehen haben. Dies verstärkt nur ihre Paranoia, da es ihnen überaus schwerfällt, bekannte Freunde von möglichen Feinden zu unterscheiden.</p>\n<h2>Gesinnung und Religion</h2>\nGolomas neigen dazu, sich auf ihr eigenes Überleben zu konzentrieren, und sind daher normalerweise Neutral. Allerdings tendieren diejenigen, die mehr Rückhalt in der Zugehörigkeit zur Gemeinschaft finden, eher zu Rechtschaffenen Gesinnungen. Golomas erweisen ihre Ehrerbietung Kalekott, dem Schutzpatron ihres Volkes und zugleich einer Gottheit der schützenden Furcht - allerdings einer, der man nicht vertrauen kann. Kalekott wird angerufen, um diejenigen zu verfluchen, die Golomas ungerecht behandeln, weil die meisten das Gefühl haben, dass Gerechtigkeit nur mit übernatürlichen Mitteln erreicht werden kann. Andere beliebte Götter umfassen Mazludeh und Großmutter Spinne, welche die Stärke der Gemeinschaft fördern. Allerdings ist die Idee von Gemeinschaft bei Golomas meist sehr schwach ausgeprägt und selten.</p>\n<h2>Namen</h2>\n<p>Der wahre Name eines Golomas wird ausschließlich unter ihrem eigenen Volk geäußert, da es Hunderte von warnenden Geschichten gibt, die davon handeln, was alles passieren kann, wenn eine andere Kreatur den wahren Namen eines Golomas erfährt. Die wahren Namen der Golomas weisen meist kaum weiche Silben auf, da es ihnen schwerfällt, diese auszusprechen. Ein typischer Goloma-Name besteht daher für Gewöhnlich aus einer Aneinanderreihung harter Konsonanten und einzelnen betonten Vokalen. Gegenüber anderen Völkern neigen Golomas dazu, Namen zu verwenden, die sie offensichtlich einschüchtern sollen. Sie verwenden dazu gerne Elemente und Klänge aus den Sprachen Aklo, Nekril oder Worte aus hiesigen Sprachen, die starke Reaktionen hervorzurufen scheinen.</p>\n<h3>Beispielnamen</h3>\n<p>Biqkuul, Ehbouja, Haamaah, Kouzo, Quaerjii, Tebaazu, Uruueda, Zekuukeu</p>\n<h2>Spielmechanik</h2>\n<p><strong>Trefferpunkte</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Größe</strong> Mittelgroß</p>\n<p><strong>Bewegungsrate</strong> 30 Fuß/9 m</p>\n<p><strong>Attributsverbesserungen</strong> Weisheit, Frei</p>\n<p><strong>Sprachen</strong> Goloma, Mwangisch</p>\n<p><strong>Weitere Sprachen</strong> entsprechend deines Intelligenzbonus.

          "text": "<p>Claiming no place as their own, halflings control few settlements larger than villages. Instead, they frequently live among humans within larger cities, carving out small communities alongside taller folk. Optimistic, cheerful, and driven by powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for their short stature with an abundance of bravado. At once excitable and easygoing, halflings are the best kind of opportunists, and their passions favor joy over violence. While their curiosity sometimes drives them toward adventure, halflings also carry strong ties to house and home.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who must contend with these opposing drives toward adventure and comfort, you should play a halfling.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Get along well with a wide variety of people and enjoy meeting new friends.</li>\n<li>Find it difficult to resist indulging your curiosity, even when you know it's going to lead to trouble.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your ability to always find a silver lining or something to laugh about, no matter how dire the situation.</li>\n<li>Think you bring good luck with you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Halflings are short humanoids who look vaguely like smaller humans. They rarely grow to be more than 3 feet in height. Halfling proportions vary, with some looking like shorter adult humans with slightly larger heads and others having proportions closer to those of a human child.</p>\n<p>Most halflings prefer to walk barefoot rather than wear shoes, and those who do so develop roughly calloused soles on their feet over time. Tufts of thick, often-curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Halfling skin tones tend toward rich, tawny shades like amber or oak, and their hair color ranges from a light golden blond to raven black.</p>\n<p>Halflings reach physical adulthood around the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to be around 150 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Despite their jovial and friendly nature, halflings don't usually tend to congregate. They have few cultural centers in the Inner Sea region, and they instead tend to weave themselves throughout the societies of the world. Halflings eke out whatever living they can manage, many performing menial labor or holding simple service jobs. Some halflings reject city life, instead turning to the open road and traveling from place to place in search of fortune and fame. These nomadic halflings often travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends and family. Halfling names are usually two to three syllables, with a gentle sound that avoids hard consonants. Preferring their names to sound humble, halflings see overly long or complex names as a sign of arrogance for their people. However, they understand that elves and humans might have longer names to suit their own aesthetics.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Anafa, Antal, Bellis, Boram, Etune, Filiu, Jamir, Kaleb, Linna, Marra, Miro, Rillka, Sistra, Sumak, Yamyra</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Halflings are loyal to their friends and their family, but they aren't afraid to do what needs to be done in order to survive. Wherever halflings go, they seamlessly blend into the society they find themselves in, adapting to the culture and beliefs of the predominant ancestry around them and adding their uniquely halfling twists, creating a blend of cultural diffusion that enriches both cultures. Halflings favor gods that either grant luck, like Desna, or encourage guile, like Norgorber, and many appreciate Cayden Cailean's role as a liberator, as well as any religions common among other ancestries around them.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>share good meals with friends and strangers alike, stand up to bullies and oppressors, stay beneath the taller folk's notice</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>take your luck for granted</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Halfling Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Strength</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Halfling</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

The Avistani cycle of unthinking conflict with hobgoblins has recently been upended by Oprak, the newly established hobgoblin nation in the mountains between Nidal and Nirmathas. Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other nations, these hobgoblins have begun to cautiously investigate in the spirit of cooperation rather than conquest.

Even civilian groups such as farming collectives or trading houses organize into regiments, companies, and divisions. Hobgoblin veterans hold a high place in their society, usually becoming leaders or advisors.

On rare occasions, hobgoblins will alter their names, keeping the core but adding aspects, usually in response to extreme trauma or a life-altering event.

Ebenso können starke Bindungen zu bestimmten Kreaturen derselben Heimatumgebung dazu führen, dass ein Kaschrischi entsprechende Muster oder Färbungen ausbildet. Manche Geschichten erzählen sogar von Kaschrischis mit Schmetterlingsflügeln und -mustern, auch wenn man solche Vertreter dieser Abstammung seit wenigstens einhundert Jahren nicht mehr in den Unfassbaren Landen gesehen hat.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Trotz ihrer geringen Größe sind Kaschrischis beinahe unfähig sich zu verstecken. Ihre Kristallhörner flackern in magischem Licht, wenn sie ihre angeborenen magischen Kräfte nutzen, und sie wachsen in Umgebungen auf, wo ihre Eltern oder Beschützer sie nahezu immer anhand ihrer Gefühle aufspüren können. Deshalb neigen Kaschrischis zu exzessiver Ehrlichkeit und Freundlichkeit und vermeiden schädliche Täuschungen, verhalten sich aber auch taktvoll genug, um keine unangenehmen emotionalen Reaktionen bei anderen hervorzurufen.</p>\n<p>Kaschrischis besitzen kein klares Konzept von Mildtätigkeit; dies liegt nicht daran, dass sie vielleicht grausam oder gleichgültig wären, sondern an dem Umstand, dass ihr Weltbild von Beginn an alle um sie herum einschließt. Tatsächlich sind Kaschrischis, welche sich beiläufig grausam verhalten oder andere Mitglieder der Gemeinschaft im Stich lassen, sehr selten. Solche Handlungen führen zu emotionalen Reaktionen, die alle anderen Kaschrischis in der Umgebung in innere Unruhe versetzen.</p>\n<p>Kaschrischis mögen Gruppenspiele und nutzen Ratespiele als Möglichkeit, das eigene Wissen und die eigenen übernatürlichen Fähigkeiten zu präsentieren. Ebenso lieben sie Spiele, bei denen sie bluffen müssen, sich aber nicht anmerken lassen dürfen, dass der andere blufft, und testen so ihr Können, den Verstand frei und die Gedanken organisiert zu halten. Es ist kein Tabu für sie, mit Nichtkaschrischis Glücksspiel zu betreiben, da viele in ihren Fähigkeiten eine zusätzliche Herausforderung sehen, selbst wenn sie den genauen Umfang der individuellen Kräfte vielleicht geheim halten.</p>\n<p>Kaschrischis sind in der Regel monogam ohne spezifische Vorlieben für ein bestimmtes Geschlecht. Für einen Kaschrischi ist es der Höhepunkt an Intimität, seinen Geist völlig für die mentale Verbindung zu einem anderen seiner Art zu öffnen, was weitaus persönlicher als jeder körperliche Akt ist. Diese Handlung lässt die Kaschrischis nicht erkennen, ob sie perfekt zueinander passen - sie können nur ihre Gefühle besser erkennen, sodass die Kommunikation nicht auf Herumraten basiert, sondern eine eigene Art von Erfahrung darstellt. Manche Kaschrischis sind der Ansicht, dass mentale Kommunikation nur für diese intimen Momente genutzt werden sollte.</p>\n<p>Kaschrischis leben in kleinen Gruppen auf der Insel Jalmeray und in größeren Gemeinschaften auf den vielen kleinen Insel rund um Jalmeray. Die Kaschrischis der Region der Inneren See verlassen nur selten die Unfassbaren Lande, auch wenn einige ihrer ältesten Legenden von einer entsetzlichen Reise über den Obarischen Ozean berichten, als sie vor Ewigkeiten vor einer Katastrophe geflohen sind.</p>\n<p>Kaschrischis haben keine natürlichen Feinde. Sie heißen Piraten und Händler mit demselben Maß an Gastfreundschaft willkommen, solange ihre Gäste diese Gastfreundschaft respektieren. Auch wenn sie extrem tolerant gegenüber den Macken und Marotten anderer Völker sind, ziehen sie doch eine klare Grenze, wenn jemand Konflikte von außen in ihre Gemeinschaften tragen will. Mehr als ein listiger Piratenkapitän geht am Ufer einer Kaschrischi-Insel nach einem heißen Gefecht vor Anker im Wissen, dass ihn verfolgende Piratenjäger und Schiffe der Marine sich vom Land der Kaschrischis fernhalten. Auch entflohene Kriminelle auf der Suche nach einem Neuanfang könnten sich ebenso in einem Kaschrischidorf verbergen und ihren Gastgebern nach Kräften helfen, bis ihre Verfolger die Jagd aufgegeben haben.</p>\n<h2>Gesinnung und Religion</h2>\n<p>Kaschrischis besitzen eine gute Gesinnung und verhalten sich beinahe instinktiv freundlich aufgrund ihrer empathischen Fähigkeiten und eng zusammenhaltenden Gemeinschaften. Sie sind nur selten an Religion interessiert, wobei bei einigen Gottheiten die Wahrscheinlichkeit höher ist als bei anderen, unter Kaschrischis Anhänger zu finden: Desna kennen sie als den „Kristallschmetterling“ und sollte ein Kaschrischikind vermisst werden, könnte die Eltern zum Kristallschmetterling beten, sie möge das Licht ihrer Flügel nutzen, um das Kind nach Haus zu geleiten. Auch Besmara hat Kaschrischianhänger, wobei diese im Grunde eine Sekte darstellen, die sie in erster Linie als Herrin der Seeungeheuer und Stürme kennen und ihre anderen Lehren ignorieren.</p>\n<h2>Namen</h2>\n<p>Jeder Kaschrischi besitzt aufgrund des Empathiegespürs eine einzigartige Ausstrahlung, anhand derer er von seinen Artgenossen erkannt werden kann. Dieser „mentale Fingerabdruck“ kann im Rahmen mentaler Kommunikation als Name vermittelt werden. Zieht ein Kaschrischi mit Nichtkaschrischis ins Abenteuer aus, legt er sich meistens einen beschreibenden Namen zu, der für seine Begleiter leichter auszusprechen ist und den sie nicht so schnell vergessen.</p>\n<h3>Beispielnamen</h3>\n<p>Feuerhorn, Heiler, Kletterer, Krieger, Leuchte, Mutter, Späher, Sturm, Wächter, Zarthand</p>\n<h2>Kaschrischi-Herkünfte</h2>\n<p>Die Herkunft eines Kaschrischis reflektiert die einzigartigen Weise, in der er sich an seine ausgewählte Umgebung anpasst.

          "name": "Kitsune",
          "text": "<p><em>Kitsune are a charismatic and witty people with a connection to the spiritual that grants them many magical abilities, chiefly the power to shapechange into other forms. Whether they pass unseen among other peoples or hold their tails high, kitsune are clever observers of the societies around them.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Kitsune are shapechangers with two forms: one of a fox-headed humanoid and one largely depending on where they were raised. Those raised in populated areas typically have what's called a tailless form—a humanoid body without any fox features that resembles a more common ancestry, such as an elf or a human. In wooded or rural areas, their second form is more likely to be that of a fox.</p>\n<p>Though all-kitsune settlements exist, most live among people of other ancestries, granting them a degree of external insight into social rules or dynamics that others process only subconsciously. Kitsune enjoy subverting expectations as much as they do going along with them. Their fondness for jokes, stories, and wordplay, especially when the twist of a riddle hinges on the listener's assumptions, reinforces their reputation as tricksters.</p>\n<p>With dual forms and a connection to both the material and spiritual worlds, kitsune have diverse concepts of self and identity. Some even view their forms as separate individuals altogether, using them to explore different aspects of their personality.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character with innate magical talents and countless hidden facets, each revealed with a glint of the eye and a twisting grin, you should play a kitsune.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Studiously observe the habits of those around you, taking mental notes on how to imitate them better.</li>\n<li>Delight in jokes, clever wordplay, pranks, or unnecessarily complex plots.</li>\n<li>Present a different, but authentic, side of yourself in each new situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are taken in by your magnetic personality and enigmatic nature.</li>\n<li>Marvel at your many supernatural abilities.</li>\n<li>Wonder what you aren't telling them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kitsune have alert vulpine ears, pointed snouts, and short, semi-retractable claws on their fingers and toes. Their fur is dense, countershaded, and most often red,tan, black, or white in color. Kitsune have bushy tails that grow in number as they hone their innate magical abilities, to as many as nine.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kitsune are rarely the majority in whatever communities they inhabit, and many go their whole lives without meeting another kitsune beyond their family. Their society, as much as it exists, centers primarily around the commonalities that kitsune find as they pass among other peoples. The same social perspective that helps them imitate others also makes them quick to notice signs that someone may need help or a kind word. Due to this, kitsune often form strong interpersonal relationships and tend to anchor their social circles.</p>\n<p>When two kitsune do meet, they may find themselves exchanging light verbal repartee, enjoying the sport of trying to outwit each other. While it's considered a grave offense to outright give away another kitsune's shapechanging nature, kitsune relish surreptitiously forcing another to \"break character,\" shocking the other into disrupting their transformation through a well-placed comment.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Kitsune often have neutrality in their alignment from balancing their dual natures, though their instinct for stirring up trouble leads many to lean slightly toward chaos. Some possess the ability to control or bend the will of others, but even among those that do, only the evilest use these arts flippantly or selfishly.</p>\n<p>The patron kitsune deity is Daikitsu, the goddess of crafting and agriculture. Though not all kitsune necessarily worship Daikitsu, most respect her as the purported source of their powers. Kitsune in Tian Xia often revere both Shizuru and Tsukiyo, seeing the duality of the sun and moon in their own multifaceted nature. A small sect of Avistani kitsune worship Sivanah, the goddess of illusion, respecting her position between perception and reality and believing the goddess's true form to be that of a kitsune-hidden behind not seven veils, but nine.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>While kitsune have some traditional names, they're more likely to use names that are unremarkable in their local society, the better to pass unnoticed. Some have different names for each form: a kitsune name for their kitsune form, a regional name for a tailless form, and possibly no name at all for a fox form.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Hamako, Haohiko, Kitsukou, Kon, Kwan-la, Talaro</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Kitsune Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Kholo are eminently practical and pragmatic hunters and raiders. To them, honor is just another word for pointless risk. Any loss of a kholo affects not just the individual, but their packmates and kin as well. Wasting time on anything but victory, whether it's mercy or cruelty, is seen as little shy of immoral. Kholo are masters of ambushes, tactical feints, and psychological warfare. Equally misunderstood is the kholo practice of ancestor worship and endocannibalism. Kholo consume their dead as a sign of reverence, holding a grand feast and transforming the bones into art or weapons.

Kholo are considered adults at 15 and live about 60 years on average.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kholo generally live in semi-nomadic clans of 10 to 20 family groups, containing between 100 to 200 members. They are ruled by a council of female kholo who are typically selected from the elders of each family. Bonekeepers focus on tending to the wishes of kholo ancestors and gods—they take their name from the ancestral bones that festoon their clothing and homes.

Kobolds seek out these alliances out of a sense of pragmatism—after all, who would dare bully a kobold who serves an ancient dragon?—but also because kobold eggs incubated near such loci of power take on physical traits (and sometimes abilities) similar to those of the warren's benefactor. On their own, kobolds are ingenious crafters and devoted allies, but outsiders who trespass into their territory find them to be inspired skirmishers and clever ambushers. However, these reptilian opportunists prove happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it's to their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make their fortunes in the wider world.</p>\n<p>If you want a character with deadly cunning and who bears the mark of a powerful benefactor, you should play a kobold.</p>\n<h2>You might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyze your surroundings, always looking for ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume that you are cowardly and won't stick around in the face of danger.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness, especially when it comes to building defenses</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall), reptilian humanoids with slender bodies, long tails, and stout horns.

Some rare kobolds live even longer after harnessing the power of a magical benefactor.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them alive. They're secretive or subservient around powerful creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades once kobolds secure either a formidable benefactor (like a dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an artifact or sorcerous leader). Kobold societies regularly adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by their benefactor's personality. However, kobolds are infamous for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.</p>\n<p>A young kobold's given name is rarely more than a syllable or two.

As much as they are happy to accept someone who earns their trust into their family, they expect family members to look out for them and their natural wards in return. Leshies are grouped into categories akin to ethnicities, but these are not connected to physical features; rather, they represent broad categories of characteristics of their spirits. Certain spirits are more likely to gravitate toward particular physical bodies, though this predisposition is far from absolute. Leshies' genders are determined by the spirits that inhabit their bodies. Some leshies are exclusively male or female, while many consider themselves both.

        "Merfolk": {
          "name": "Aquarier",
          "text": "<p>Aquarier gibt es in jedem Ozean Golarions in ähnlich unbegrenzter Vielfalt wie Menschen an Land und voll ehrfurchtgebietender Majestät. Sie betrachten sich selbst (nicht ganz grundlos) als die Herrscher der See. Zwischen den tropischen Riffen der Fiebersee haben sie Tempel und Paläste aus farbenfrohen Korallen errichtet. Unter den Eisschollen der Schimmersee gehen sie in kleinen Stämmen auf die Jagd nach Robben und Walen, die mit niemandem sonst etwas zu tun haben wollen. Aquarier bevölkern auch die große Handelsstadt Alohmab, welche im Haus einer titanischen Schnecke gebaut wurde, die über den Meeresboden kriecht.</p>\n<p>Der Alltag eines Aquariers unterscheidet sich gar nicht so sehr von dem eines Oberflächenbewöhners, allerdings besitzt er eine weitaus intimere Beziehung zur Magie. In der aquatischen Umgebung des offenen Meeres ist vieles nicht möglich, für das Feuer und Metall erforderlich wären. Stattdessen formen die Aquarier Geräusche und Wasser mittels Magie und nutzen beides als Werkzeuge und Waffen. Solches Können ist quasi in allen Aquariergemeinschaften vorhanden und es gibt genug Begabte, die keine formelle magische Ausbildung erhalten haben.</p>\n<p>Falls du einen Charakter spielen möchtest, der die Eleganz, die Wunder und die Gefahren der See verkörpert, solltest du einen Aquarier spielen.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest...</h2><ul>\n<li>Magie als normales Werkzeug betrachten – und damit als gewöhnlich und nützlich, statt als sublimes Mysterium.</li>\n<li>dich überlegen fühlen, wenn es um Wasser geht, sei es dass du arrogante Abscheu für jeden zeigst, der schwimmt oder segelt, oder elterliche Sorge, dass sie sich selbst verletzen könnten.</li>\n</ul><h2>Andere könnten...</h2><ul>\n<li>von deinen musischen und mystischen Gaben beeindruckt sein.</li>\n<li>annehmen, dass sich das Leben unter Wasser vollkommen von dem an der Oberfläche unterscheidet.</li>\n</ul><h2>Körperliche Beschreibung</h2>\n<p>Aquarier zählen zu den Abstammungen mit dem höchsten Wiedererkennungswert auf Golarion – man kann einen Aquarier kaum mit einem Angehörigen einer anderen Abstammung verwechseln. Von der Hüfte aufwärts hat ein Aquarier einen humanoiden, kräftigen Leib mit ausgeprägten aerodynamischen Eigenschaften. Die Augen sind etwas größer als bei einem Menschen. Viele Aquarier haben leicht spitzzulaufende Ohren ähnlich wie Aiuvarini. Von der Hüfte abwärts aber hat ein Aquarier den Körper eines großen Fisches mit einem langen, geschuppten Schwanz, der in einer Flosse oder einem Paar Finnen ausläuft.</p>\n<p>Unter Aquariern gibt es alle vorstellbaren Haut- und Schuppenfarben. Ihre menschlichen Oberkörper weisen meistens dieselben Hauttöne wie Menschen oder Elfen derselben Region auf – die Aquarier des Fesselinselarchipels z.B. besitzen eine gewisse Ähnlichkeit zu Lirgeni, während ihre Vettern in der Brodelnden See eher ihren ulfischen Nachbarn ähneln. Weiter vom Land entfernte Aquarier dagegen weisen Hautfärbungen auf, die mit Blau-, Grau- und sogar Grüntönen eher an Fische erinnern. Und die Aquarier der Tiefsee besitzen dunkelgraue, mitternachtsblaue oder sogar durchsichtige Haut!</p>\n<p>Die Fischschwänze der Aquarier haben Farben passend zu den lokalen Fischpopulationen. Die meisten Aquarier leben in gemäßigten Zonen; ihre Fischleiber schillern in Silbertönen mit Spuren von Grau oder Blau; tropische Aquarier dagegen könnten strahlende Farbmuster aufweisen und jene, die in der Tiefsee geboren wurden, könnten durchscheinende Schuppen oder schwach biolumineszente Streifen aufweisen.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Aquarier kann man in allen Winkeln der Ozeane antreffen, aber die größten Konzentrationen leben in der Regel in ausgedehnten aquatischen Königreichen auf den Kontinentalsockeln in gemäßigten Gewässern voller Fischen. Die Tiefsee wird von ihnen ähnlich betrachtet, wie Oberflächenbewohner Gebirge und Wüsten einstufen – einige Leute können dort leben, aber wirklich schöne Lebensbedingungen gibt es dort nicht. Ein typisches Reich der Aquarier besteht aus mehreren Dörfern und Städten; teilweise gibt es Adelsstrukturen und die damit einhergehenden höfischen politischen Intrigenspiele wie in den Monarchien der Oberfläche. Diese Unterwasserreiche unterhalten aktive diplomatische Beziehungen untereinander und schließen Allianzen und Handelsabkommen. Viele wollen wenig bis nichts mit Oberflächenbewohnern zu tun haben, manche sind aber auch von ihnen fasziniert und wollen mehr über sie erfahren; hierbei nutzen sie zuweilen besondere, wassergefüllte Mobilitätshilfen, um an Land zu kommen, oder greifen auf uralte Verwandlungsmagie zurück, um Luftatmung und Fortbewegung mit so seltsamen Dingen wie Beinen zu erlangen.</p>\n<p>Aquarier wissen Magie sehr zu schätzen, daher erwartet man von jedem Möchtegern-Anführer, dass er die Winde, die Wellen und die Magie der Lieder beherrscht. Aquarische Könige und Königinnen müssen nicht zwangsläufig die mächtigsten Zauberwirker in ihren Reichen sein, müssen sich in der Regel aber auch nicht verstecken, da sie Zugang zu Lehrmeistern, Lehrbüchern und Artefakten haben, die von einer Generation an die nächste vererbt werden.</p>\n<p>Praktische jede Aquarierkultur besitzt ihre eigenen Namensgebungstraditionen, wobei einige prädominante Tendenzen gibt. Delfinartige Klick- und walartige Gesangslaute untermalen die wohltönenden Namen der Aquarier und Variationen in der Tonhöhe und -länge helfen, ähnliche Namen voneinander zu unterscheiden. Wer öfter mit Oberflächenbewohnern zu tun hat, legt sich zudem häufig einen Namen „von oben“ zu, zumal Aquariernamen meistens seltsam und unbeholfen klingen, spricht man sie an der Luft statt im Wasser aus.</p>\n<h3>Beispielnamen</h3>\n<p>Aloori, Iri'kik, Ouliette, T'konaa, Uathanak</p>\n<h2>Glauben und Religion</h2>\n<p>Im Allgemeinen folgen Aquarier den Moralvorstellungen und Gebräuchen ihrer Eltern und der Gemeinschaften, in denen sie aufgewachsen sind. Von manchen wird z.B. erwartet, mit der Natur in Harmonie zu leben, während andere den strengen und unnachgiebigen Gesetzen ihrer Ahnen folgen. Viele Aquarier glauben, dass altruistische Taten der ganzen Gemeinschaft zugutekommen, selbst wenn sie dem Handelnden keinen sofortigen Vorteil verschaffen.</p>\n<p>Auf dem Gebiet der Götterverehrung sind sie ebenso divers wie ihre Gesellschaften. Man achtet sehr Gottheiten mit Macht über das Wasser, so dass die meisten Gemeinden einen Schrein zu Ehren Gozrehs oder eines der Elementarherrscher des Wassers - Kelizandri oder Lysianassa - unterhalten. In einigen größeren Aquarierortschaften ist Abadar beliebt und in kleineren Dörfern wird oft Erastil in einer Variante verehrt, die mehr mit Haien als mit Hirschen assoziiert wird.</p>\n<p><strong>Verbreitete Gebote</strong> Unterstütze deine Nachbarn, wo es dir möglich ist, bringe die Schönheit der Musik in die Welt, beschütze die Meere vor Gefahren von innen und außen</p>\n<p><strong>Verbreitete Anathemata</strong> Stelle dich gegen den Strom; nutze Magie um Unschuldigen zu schaden oder Reichtümer zu horten</p>\n<h2>Spielmechanik</h2>\n<p><strong>Seltenheit</strong> Ungewöhnlich</p>\n<p><strong>Trefferpunkte</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Größenkategorie</strong> Mittelgroß</p>\n<p><strong>Bewegungsrate</strong> 5 Fuß/1,50 m, Schwimmen 25 Fuß/7,50 m</p>\n<p><strong>Attributsverstärkungen</strong> Geschicklichkeit, Charisma, Frei</p>\n<p><strong>Attributsschwäche</strong> Konstitution</p>\n<p><strong>Sprachen</strong> Gemeinsprache, Thalassal, Weitere Sprachen in Höhe deines Intelligenzbonus.

        "Minotaur": {
          "name": "Minotaur",
          "text": "<p>Minotauren pirschen durch natürliche wie künstlich angelegte Labyrinthe und ähnliche Örtlichkeiten und zählen zu den Meistern der steinernen Architektur. Diese bovinen Humanoiden sind neugierig, standhaft und verbringen ihre Leben damit, jene Tätigkeiten zu perfektionieren, die sie besonders ansprechen. Dies kann sie weit in die Welt hinausführen. Ursprünglich stammen Minotauren aus dem Iblydos-Archipel. Sie haben sich aber über ganz Golarion mittlerweile ausgebreitet und eng zusammenhaltende Gemeinschaften gegründet, die sich oft in der Nähe von Bergen oder auch unterirdisch niedergelassen haben. Manche halten sie für einfältige, primitive Schläger, jedoch bringen Minotauren Gelehrte wie Krieger hervor. Wer sich von ihrem Äußeren nicht beirren lässt, erkennt, dass ihnen Baukunst, Navigation und kreative Problemlösung naheliegen.</p>\n<p>Der unter Minotauren kursierende Entstehungsmythos ihrer Art erzählt von Handwerkskunst, Flüchen und Missverständnissen. Vor Jahrtausenden war Iblydos ein Land der lebenden Gottheiten, die unter den Sterblichen lebten und über sie herrschten. Ein Steinmetz namens Tavdrinos, der von Sterblichen und Göttern bewundert wurde, erfuhr eine Vision von einem Heldengott, er möge einen glorreichen Tempel errichten – die Legende nennt aber nicht den Namen des Heldengottes. Die Vision war allerdings recht verschwommen: Krumme, schiefe Säulen, heranstürmende Stiere und mittendrin ein Unbekannter, der trotzig Widerstand leistete. Man konnte also kaum von einem ausformulierten, detailreichen Auftrag sprechen, dennoch machte Tavdrinos sich an die Arbeit und verbrachte die nächsten 17 Jahre mit dem Bau des Tempels. Das dreigeschossige Bauwerk feierte den Ruhm des Heldengottes und seines heiligen Tiers, des Stiers. Als der Heldengott erschien, erwartete Tavdrinos eigentlich, für sein Werk Lob und Entgelt zu erhalten, doch stattdessen verfiel die Gottheit in Zorn. – Der Baumeister hatte die Vision missverstanden, da der Stier eine dem Gott verhasste Bestie war und kein zelebrierter Verbündeter! Als Strafe für die ungewollte Beleidigung verfluchte der Heldengott Tavdrinos und verwandelte ihn in einen verhassten Stier. Voller Zorn über den Fluch und dass es ihm nicht gelungen war, die Gottheit zu erfreuen, zog sich der Steinmetz in eine Reihe von Höhlen unter dem Tempel zurück, wo er seine Arbeit fortsetzte, nun aber als der erste Minotaur.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest...</h2><ul>\n<li>deine Hufe und Hörner mit farbigen Mustern schmücken, die für dich von persönlicher Bedeutung sind.</li>\n<li>dich mit Navigation und Rätseln auskennen.</li>\n</ul><h2>Andere könnten…</h2><ul>\n<li>von deiner Größe eingeschüchtert sein oder dich für berechnend halten.</li>\n<li>glauben, du kannst durch Stein sehen</li>\n</ul><h2>Körperliche Beschreibung</h2>\n<p>Minotauren sind hochgewachsene, klobige Humanoide mit bovinen Merkmalen wie Hörnern, Hufen und langgestreckten Gesichtern. Ihre Fellmuster sind in der Regel von monotonen tiefbraunen oder schwarzen Tönen, aber Weiß und Grau sind auch nicht ungewöhnlich. Man könnte annehmen, dass Minotauren aufgrund ihrer Größe unbeholfen sind, doch vielmehr ist das Gegenteil der Fall. Ihre Hufe ruhen auf empfindlichen Gleichgewichtspunkten, so dass sie leise und punktgenau auftreten können. Doch wenn ein Minotaur gehört werden will, können seine Schritte wie Donner hallen.</p>\n<p>Die Hörner sind der ganze Stolz eines Minotauren und oft mit Schmuck akzentuiert. Jene mit längeren Hörnern schmü- cken sie mit Ringen und Ketten aus möglichst seltenen Metallen, färben sie oder gravieren Muster hinein. Jene mit nicht nennenswerten Hörnern rasieren stattdessen den Bereich um die Hornansätze und lassen sich die nun freien Stellen mit Kreismustern tätowieren oder setzen Metallkappen auf die Hornstummel. Auf diese Weise fallen auch ansonsten übersehene Minotauren auf.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Minotauren leben normalerweise in abgelegenen unterirdischen Enklaven zusammen. Sie sind sehr auf ihre Baukunst stolz, mit der sie Gebäude aus dem Felsen und natürlichen Höhlen hauen. Eine Enklave verfügt oft über doppelt so viele Gebäude wie benötigt – die zusätzlichen Strukturen dienen als funktionale Kunst. Junge Minotauren üben sich in den leeren Gebäuden im Jagen und Pirschen und jede Generation fügt eine kleine Erweiterung oder Wandfresken hinzu. Erweiterungen wie gewundene Gänge, unerwartete Überhänge, gemeinsame Gärten und verschiedene andere Einrichtungen schaffen Orte für Zusammenkünfte wie auch stille Ecken zur ruhigen Reflektion, solange der Reisende sich nicht in der ungewöhnlichen Architektur verirrt.</p>\n<p>Die Legenden über Minotauren machen viele glauben, sie seien blutrünstige Fleischfresser oder sogar Kannibalen. Tatsächlich sind die meisten minotaurischen Gesellschaften Jäger und Sammler und ernähren sich von Moosen und anderen Pflanzen. Ihr Ruf als gnadenlose Jäger entspringt monatlichen Ritualen, bei denen die fähigsten Pirscher ausschwärmen und gefährliche Beute zurückbringen. Die Heimkehr dieser Jäger ist eine der wenigen Gelegenheiten, zu denen Minotauren Fleisch essen und so Dankbarkeit und Verehrung für das Können der Jäger zeigen.</p>\n<p>Minotauren sind direkt und nehmen nahezu alles wörtlich – mit cleveren Wortspielen, Sarkasmus oder Ironie können sie wenig anfangen. Schnaubende Nüstern und rollende Augen können von Nichtminotauren als einschüchternd betrachtet werden, stellen für Minotauren aber oft zusätzliche Bestandteile beim Erzählen dar, um Emotionen und sogar spirituelle Elemente zu vermitteln. Wer eine bestimmte Emotion besonders betonen will, nutzt zuweilen Tätowierungen oder Körperschmuck, doch wer es mit diesem Schmuckwerk übertreibt, wirkt oft in den Augen anderer Minotauren wie ein Aufschneider. Das minotaurische Sprichwort „Ein zorniger Stier stampft einmal mit dem Huf auf und zerfleischt dich zweimal mit seinen Hörnern“ ist zugleich eine Warnung, nicht zu aggressiv aufzutreten, und eine Erinnerung, dass man jene Kreaturen fürchten muss, die Taten sprechen lassen.</p>\n<p>Iblydanische Minotauren nutzen eine ähnliche Namensgebung wie die Menschen des Archipels. Ihre Nachnamen verändern sich immer wieder, meistens um die einprägsamste Errungenschaft eines Individuums aufzuzeigen. Bis zum Erreichen des Erwachsenenalters trägt ein junger Minotaur den Nachnamen Tavdrinos (nach dem ersten Minotauren). Mit Erreichen des Erwachsenenalters geben ihm Freunde und Verbündete gemeinsam einen neuen Nachnamen. In einer Abenteurergruppe könnte ein Minotaur wiederholt von seinen Verbündeten einen Namen erhalten.</p>\n<h3>Beispielnamen</h3>\n<p>Actilea, Iraiasos, Paxaidio, Rotherion, Zavmandris</p>\n<h2>Glauben und Religion</h2>\n<p>Da die meisten minotaurischen Gemeinschaften in Isolation existieren, gehen sie Ereignisse meistens besonnen an. Viele nutzen vorurteilsbefreite Blickwinkel, die ihnen Anpassungen gestatten. Jene, die schlechte Erfahrungen mit anderen Humanoiden machen – insbesondere wenn man ihnen mit Gewalt oder Intoleranz begegnet –, könnten beschließen, sich in ein Versteck, eine Ruine oder Befestigung zurückzuziehen, die sie bis zum letzten Blutstropfen verteidigen. Hieraus resultieren viele Geschichten über brutale Minotauren.</p>\n<p>Von ihresgleichen aufgezogene Minotauren neigen dazu, sich von Gottheiten fernzuhalten – wenig überraschen angesichts ihres Schöpfungsmythos. Man betrachtet göttliche Wesenheiten als kleinlich und die Sterblichen ignorierend, vielleicht nicht vorsätzlich, da sie aufgrund ihrer gewaltigen Macht in ganz anderen Bahnen denken. Viele Minotauren übernehmen logische oder spirituelle Philosophien als Weg, ihre Existenz zu erklären. Mysterien sind Rätsel, mit deren Auflösung sich noch niemand befasst hat, die aber mit sorgfältigen Überlegungen und Studien gelöst werden können. Wenn Minotauren sich entscheiden, einer Gottheit zu folgen, werden sie hauptsächlich von jenen angezogen, die Selbstverbesserung und Selbstkontrolle im Zuständigkeitsbereich haben, z.B. Irori und Nethys.</p>\n<p><strong>Verbreitete Gebote</strong> Konstruiere Bauten von anhaltender Schönheit, suche nach immer verwirrenderen Rätseln, schärfe dein Können</p>\n<p><strong>Verbreitete Anathemata</strong> Überlasse das Schicksal sterblicher Initiative und niemals göttlichen Händen, verzichte nie auf die Möglichkeit, ein Rätsel zu untersuchen</p>\n<h2>Spielmechanik</h2>\n<p><strong>Seltenheit</strong> Ungewöhnlich</p>\n<p><strong>Trefferpunkte</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Größenkategorie</strong> Groß</p>\n<p><strong>Bewegungsrate</strong> 25 Fuß/7,50 m</p>\n<p><strong>Attributsverstärkungen</strong> Stärke, Konstitution, Frei</p>\n<p><strong>Attributsschwäche</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Sprachen</strong> Gemeinsprache, Jotun, Weitere Sprachen in Höhe deines Intelligenzbonus.

        "Nagaji": {
          "name": "Nagaji",
          "text": "<p><em>Mit ihren humanoiden Körpern und schlangenartigen Köpfen sind die Nagajis die Herolde, Begleiter und Diener mächtiger Nagas. Sie verehren aus ganzem Herzen heilige Orte und spirituelle Wahrheiten, was andere ebenso als einschüchternd betrachten wie ihr Äußeres.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Die Nagajis sind Schöpfungen der Göttin Nalinivati, welche durch Menschen und Nagas dazu inspiriert wurde. Diese Inspiration und die Treue der Nagajis gegenüber Nagas lässt viele behaupten, dass sie als Diener erschaffen wurden. Nalinivati hat sie aber lediglich um des Erschaffens willen geschaffen; sie hatte die Vision einer Welt, auf der Nagas und Nagajis zusammen den Weg zum Erfolg beschreiten - die Nagas als heilige Wächter und die Nagajis als sterbliche Golarier, welche die Nagas wegen ihrer Stärke und Weisheit respektieren. Die Nagajis erfüllen diese Erwartungen; sie errichten Nationen, Tempel und Dörfer mit so vielen verschiedenen Regierungsformen, Gesellschaften und Traditionen, wie eine Schlange Schuppen hat. Wenn die Nagajis eine gemeinsame Eigenschaft besitzen, dann ist es die Treue, sei es gegenüber der Gemeinschaft, einem Tempel, einem Konzept oder einer Lebensweise. Die meisten werden vom Spirituellen in allen Ausprägungen angezogen, auch von den dunkleren Aspekten der Philosophien und Religionen.</p>\n<p>Falls du einen Charakter spielen willst, der zerdrückende Stärke mit dem beweglichen Mysterium einer Schlange verbindet, solltest du einen Nagaji spielen.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>...dich an den Überschneidungen von Spiritualität und Alltag erfreuen.</li>\n<li>...über große Geduld bei Aufgaben verfügen, die andere langweilig finden.</li>\n<li>...umfassende Ansichten zu deinem Platz im Universum besitzen und tiefschürfenden Traditionen folgen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Andere könnten...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>...glauben, dass du nur daran interessiert wärst, den Nagas zu dienen.</li>\n<li>...durch deine Schlangenmerkmale und den Umstand eingeschüchtert werden, dass du nicht blinzelst.</li>\n<li>...Ehrfurcht vor deiner Verbindung und Treue zu heiligen Stätten der Natur verspüren.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Körperliche Beschreibung</h2>\n<p>Nagajis neigen zu starken körperlichen Unterschieden. Manche haben Beine und einen Schlangenschwanz, manche besitzen an Händen und Füßen messerscharfe Krallen und manche stechen derart selbst unter Ihresgleichen hervor, dass sie eher für Lamien gehalten werden. Am weitesten ist die Kombination aus humanoidem Körper und Schlangenkopf verbreitet. Meistens besitzen sie die nichtblinzelnden Augen von Schlangen, auch wenn andere oft behaupten, der Blick eines Nagajis sei noch intensiver. Die Körper sind von Schlangenschuppen bedeckt, deren Muster an Nagas oder Schlangen erinnern. Abhängig von der Herkunft könnte der Hals so lang wie der eines Schwans oder kurz wie der eines Menschen sein. Viele haben einen Haut- oder Schuppenkamm, der den Rücken hinabläuft. Nagajis verfügen oft über eine zermalmende Kraft, deren Manifestation aber variiert - manche sind klobig gebaut, während andere schlank sind, aber über die kräftige Muskulatur einer Schlange verfügen.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Nagajigemeinschaften unterscheiden sich stark voreinander; es gibt uralte Großreiche und winzige Fischerdörfer und alles dazwischen. Sie neigen dazu, sich von anderen Völkern zu isolieren. Dies ist eher eine Frage der Bequemlichkeit als der Wahl - Nagajis haben andere körperliche Bedürfnisse als die meisten Abstammungen, daher neigen sie dazu, unter sich zu bleiben, selbst wenn sie in gemischte Gemeinschaften integriert wurden. Von Nagajigemeinschaft zu Nagajigemeinschaft gibt es alle möglichen Unterschiede, was Themen wie Hochzeitstraditionen, Religion, gesellschaftliche Rollen, geschätzte Künste und Regierungsweisen angeht. Die Nagajis derselben Gemeinschaft besitzen dann meistens aber sehr strenge und traditionelle Ansichten. Zwischen Nagajigruppen kommt es immer wieder zu Kriegen, wenn eine Gruppe die Verhaltensweisen der anderen als nicht akzeptabel ansieht. Diese Sichtweise gilt auch bei Beziehungen zu anderen Völkern. So betrachten sich die meisten Nagajis z.B. aufgrund ihrer alten Legenden als Rivalen und Feinde der Garudas, auch wenn sie vielleicht noch nie einen Garuda gesehen haben.</p>\n<p>Die Ursprünge der Nagajis liegen im Land Nagajor in Tian Xia. Sie haben sich zwar mittlerweile über die Welt bis in Regionen wie Vudra und Jalmeray ausgebreitet, haben oft aber die Traditionen ihrer Heimat mitgebracht. Tianische und vudrische Konzepte der Elemente, Medizin und Spiritualität sind unter Nagajis stark verbreitet, insbesondere da sie sich selbst als sehr gläubige Wesen betrachten. Von dem menschlichen Konzept der Kasten halten die meisten nichts, sieht man von einer vagen Einschätzung der „natürlichen Ordnung“ ab, derzufolge Nagas heilige Anführer der sterblichen Nagajis sind. Sie können aber erkennen, dass manche vom Konzept des Karmas und der Rechtschaffenheit des Erfüllens ihrer Rolle im Universum angesprochen werden. Auch wenn Nagajis sich normalerweise in heißen und feuchten Umgebungen aufhalten und Kleidung eigentlich nicht benötigen, tragen sie sie mit Stolz und behandeln sie als dekorative Elemente ähnlich wie Schmuck.</p>\n<p>Da Nagas in der Regel matriarchalisch organisiert sind, besitzen Nagajis großen Respekt vor Frauen in Führungspositionen. Nicht alle organisieren sich selbst so, doch in der Regel verfolgen sie ihre Abstammungen über die Mutter. Nahezu keine Nagajigesellschaft ist völlig patriarchalisch.</p>\n<h2>Gesinnung und Religion</h2>\n<p>Die meisten Nagajis besitzen eine neutrale Gesinnungskomponente, fühlen sich ansonsten aber zu keiner Gesinnung speziell hingezogen. Die Anwesenheit einer Naga kann Nagajis dazu bringen, ihre Moralvorstellungen zu übernehmen, doch ansonsten werden ihre Ansichten eher von der Kultur bestimmt, welcher sie angehören.</p>\n<p>Nagajis verehren ihre Schöpfergottheit Nalinivati in einem Maße, dass sie sehr negativ reagieren, sollte einer von ihnen eine andere Gottheit anbeten. Eine Ausnahme ist Ravithra, die angebliche Mutter der Nagas, deren Verehrung wird abgenickt und auch eher akzeptiert, jedoch glauben die meisten, dass man Ravithra nicht mit den Bitten sterblicher Gläubiger belästigen sollte. Eine sehr kleine Minderheit der Nagajis von Jalmeray fühlt sich zur Verehrung des Kriegsgottes Diomazul hingezogen; andere Nagajis tolerieren dies, betrachten diese Gläubigen aber als ebenso furchterweckend und gefährlich wie ihren Schutzgott, sodass sie ihnen meistens aus dem Weg gehen.</p>\n<h2>Namen</h2>\n<p>Nagajinamen variieren je nach Region, weisen in der Regel aber nur kurze Vokale auf, falls überhaupt. Die meisten wählen ihre Namen selbst oder erlauben dies ihren Geschwistern - letztere Tradition führt dazu, dass sie bei Erreichen des Erwachsenenalters sich oftmals rasch neue Namen zulegen.</p>\n<h3>Beispielnamen</h3>\n<p>Adescha, Garija, Kaya, Kuwana, Onok, Paravata, Scheni, Takascha, Tasi, Ulu, Vaski, Yulbin</p>\n<h2>Nagaji-Herkünfte</h2>\n<p>Die nagajische Physiologie variiert allgemein zwischen Individuen.

Orcs who attain both a long life and great triumphs command immense respect.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is hardy, fearsome, and excels at feats of physical prowess, you should play an orc.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Eagerly meet any chance to prove your strength in a physical contest.</li>\n<li>View dying in glorious combat as preferable to a mundane death from old age or illness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>See you as violent or lacking in discipline.</li>\n<li>Admire your forthrightness and blunt honesty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Orcs are tall and powerfully built, with long arms and stocky legs. Many orcs top 7 feet in height, though they tend to adopt broad, almost bow-legged stances and slouch forward at the shoulders. Orcs have rough skin, thick bones, and rock-hard muscles, making them suited to war and other physically demanding tasks. Orc skin color is typically some shade of green, though some orcs have other skin colors that reflect adaptations to their environments.</p>\n<p>Orcs consider powerful builds, heavily scarred skin, large tusks, and tattoos attractive, regardless of gender. Orcs reach physical adulthood around the age of 17, with many orcs living to be up to 60 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Most orc communities—known as holds—define themselves through two things: pain and glory. Each earns respect in near equal measure, so long as the pain is borne with stoicism. An orc with many scars who walks uncomplaining with a broken leg draws as much admiration as one who wins a great victory on the battlefield. Additionally, power defines the dynamics among families and holds. Weaker orcs work at the behest of the strong, with power constantly shifting between orcs that prove their might. Orcs tend to share in familial duties, raising children as a community and sharing responsibilities among the entire hold.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Arkus, Durra, Grask, Grillgiss, Krugga, Mahja, Murdut, Ollak, Onyat, Thurk, Uirch, Unach</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>A common orc saying is \"you are the scars that shape you.\" Violent, chaotic lives in violent, chaotic lands mean that most orcs tend to expect and accept violence. Lamashtu, and Rovagug are commonly worshiped among more war-minded orc communities, while less violent holds worship gods like Sarenrae, whose tenets of fire, redemption, and glory all hold some appeal to orc sensibilities.</p>\n<p>While there are orc deities, their worship is surprisingly uncommon among orcs. Orcs believe that if a creature has a face and a name, it can be killed, and so their own deities are often targets, rather than objects of reverence. Some orc holds teach that the greatest members of the hold can earn a chance to challenge the orc deities for a place amid the pantheon.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p> become even stronger, share knowledge you won through pain, destroy the undead</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p> accept defeat without proof of strength, reshape or reanimate a creature into something lesser</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Orc Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Two free attribute boosts</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Orcish</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

        "Poppet": {
          "name": "Puppenkonstrukt",
          "text": "<p><em>Poppets are small, basic constructs that typically help their owners with simple tasks. Occasionally, poppets gain sapience, independence, and a spark of life. Elevated beyond mere helpers or playthings, these poppets are free to chart their own destinies.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Most commonly made of cloth, wicker, and wood, poppets are among the simplest of constructs. They serve as helpers to fetch tools, clean dishes, tidy rooms, or perform other light tasks. Their size and appearance vary, but nearly all poppets appear humanoid in shape and between 1 to 3 feet tall. They're usually roughly made with button eyes sewn onto blank faces, strings of yarn in place of hair, and a simple dress or tunic made from coarse, cheap cloth. Wealthy families sometimes purchase poppets as toys, with their squishy bodies and stitched smiles, to keep their children company. Most poppets can't speak and lack the intellect to understand speech beyond preprogrammed orders. Poppets can become familiars.</p>\n<p>Very, very rarely, a common poppet spontaneously manifests a spark of life-a tiny bit of life essence- and becomes a thinking, independent creature. These events are exceedingly rare; fewer than one in a thousand gain this spark. A poppet might manifest this life essence through a magical fluke in its construction, a brush with ephemeral spirits, or even the fervent wish of a loving child. Whatever their origin, the poppets described here as an ancestry have their own life and free will. They might consider their creators or former owners to be friends, but they acknowledge no one as their master and often leave comfortable homes or workshops to seek their place in the world.</p>\n<p>Sapient living poppets usually refer to themselves as \"awakened\" to indicate the moment they gained clear and true self‑awareness. Poppets might talk about this event as the time they \"popped up,\" \"woke up,\" or \"sparked alive.\" Most poppets celebrate two special anniversaries each year: the day of their initial creation (which, for most poppets, they must learn secondhand or by studying their creator's records) and the day they awoke to true consciousness.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Like surprising others with your unexpected cleverness and eloquence.</li>\n<li>Seek out other self-aware beings that most people might overlook.</li>\n<li>Rely on your harmless appearance to trick others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mistake you for a toy.</li>\n<li>Doubt your ability to handle tasks that require any dexterity or complex thought.</li>\n<li>Wonder whether your mundane form conceals other magical marvels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Living poppets are both humanoids and constructs, which gives them some of the benefits and drawbacks of each category. Their bodies are usually made of wood and wicker, but they can be made of cloth, leather, tin, stuffing, or delicate clockwork. Either way, poppets burn or melt quickly and must take care to avoid fire. They virtually never look alike, as each is created from unique and unusual circumstances.</p>\n<p>Poppets are fully alert and self‑aware when they awaken to sentience; although they might not know much at first, they instantly gain intelligence and consciousness. They must breathe and sleep, and they must consume food and water each day; through a sort of magical digestion they can restore rips, tears, or scuffs in their physical form. Poppets don't age the same way fleshy creatures do, but they slowly wear down in physical form as well as in mental acuity. A poppet that tends to their body and mind (and takes care to avoid fire) can live up to 30 years.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Free‑willed poppets are so rare that almost no such poppet has met another. Poppets normally live with larger creatures, though not always their creators, and tend to get along well in societies sized for larger creatures. Most live in cities because that's where toy makers, clockwork crafters, and other specialists have their shops, but poppets created by lonely hermits or reclusive inventors might prefer a life in the wilderness. Poppets often stay on the lookout for other creatures who, like them, have stumbled into self‑awareness. They might have regular conversations with animated objects, golems, houseplants, statues, or toys, in which they're deeply polite out of a desire to leave a good impression for the time when the object \"wakes up.\"</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Ordinary poppets are built as helpers and companions, and awakened poppets tend to retain this drive to aid others. They're therefore generally good, and more poppets are lawful than chaotic. Some spend their time trying to uncover secrets of their creation, find others like them, or keep out of trouble; these poppets are generally neutral in alignment. Poppets aren't typically religious unless a particular faith defined their creation, such as being made from scraps of Iomedaean altar cloth or woven from reeds around a sacred Gozren pool. These poppets tend to be vocally religious, even zealous, in their faith. Poppets who find religion later in their lives often revere Brigh, Casandalee, or Nethys.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Poppets generally choose their own names, usually descriptive nicknames based on their materials, patterns, size, or demeanor. They tend to pick up and shed nicknames throughout their lives, and they happily adopt nicknames given to them by people they like. A poppet fashioned to look like a particular person, such as a doll sewn to resemble a deceased child, might proudly take the name of that person.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Burlap, Buttoneyes, Checker, Clockwhirr, Fivestitch, Nettle, Scramble, Stuffing, Taffeta, Tattercap</p>\n<h2>Poppets of the Inner Sea</h2>\n<p>Awkward and endearing, poppets are well‑regarded in all but the most insular and superstitious communities of Golarion. They're known to be able, helpful, and loyal little creatures who support a master's work or make an aristocrat's life easier, which is particularly true in large trade cities such as Absalom, Almas, the city of Katapesh, and Katheer. The key difference between ordinary poppets and living poppets, in most people's experiences, is responsive speech. Ordinary poppets usually can't talk; if they can, they reproduce only a few preprogrammed phrases by rote. They normally communicate with strangers via notes pinned to their bodies, like walking note boards. Awakened poppets not only talk but carry on lengthy, expressive conversations, which likely strikes even the most jaded urbanite as a marvelous wonder.</p>\n<p>In regions where an entrenched nobility enjoys flaunting their wealth, poppets are even built specifically as toys. Taldor and Cheliax teem with aristocrats who pamper their children, grooming them for a life of leisure and devotion to family honor. These children have the best and most expensive toys, including poppets in fancy, frilly clothing. Such poppets are sometimes armed with subtle weaponry to fight against kidnappers or assassins who threaten their charges. Commoners in these nations treat poppets with deference and caution, as no one wants to risk the wrath of a spoiled scion. Awakened poppets from these lands sometimes believe themselves members of the aristocracy and can be snooty.</p>\n<p>In nations such as Nex, Osirion, and Katapesh, where magic flows freely, construct servitors are common. As many people expect to see familiars and homunculi in their daily routines, a busy poppet rarely draws much attention. Such poppets are assumed to be on tasks for powerful masters, but they don't command too much respect-after all, if the task were truly important, the master wouldn't have sent a simple poppet. Poppets in these regions can expect to have to wait in lines, pester trade workers to get their attention, or barter like anyone else. They also tend to have simple and functional appearances with few ornamentations and a tendency to look shabby from years of work. Thus, poppets from these lands have a deeper understanding of common folk from spending so much time shoulder to shoulder (or, more likely, shoulder to thigh) among them.</p>\n<p>Some poppets originate from crafted sophistication more so than magical skill. They might be cunning clockworks with interlocking piston‑powered gears or simply wood and wicker with ingenious hinges and well‑calibrated mechanisms inside. Others might look like toy soldiers or have visages of smooth, thin metal. Such poppets are most common in Alkenstar, Numeria, or around Absalom's Clockwork Cathedral. They often worry about rust, grit, or water spoiling their inner workings, to the point of being fussy.</p>\n<p>There are few areas where poppets are outright feared, but Ustalav is one of them. Whispered stories of ghosts or curses tell tales of common objects, or even toys, given dread animation to inflict misery on a household, making citizens highly suspicious of poppets. This belief is unfortunate because Ustalav has more than its share of the creatures; eccentric inventors, professors desperate to prove abstruse theories, and possessing spirits from beyond the grave might give a poppet the spark of life. These poppets learn caution quickly, lest they be thrown into a bonfire or lake.</p>\n<p>Because they're made from fragile materials, most poppets don't last very long before breaking down. A few rare exceptions survive from powerful ancient empires with well‑known mastery of constructs, such as the Azlanti Empire or the Jistka Imperium. These poppets might be incredibly old-older than they'll ever know, as such poppets awakened recently within an ancient ruin usually have no solid recollections of their creators or their original purpose. These poppets pose perhaps the deepest mysteries, as they might hold the keys to unlock secrets of lost civilizations.</p>\n<h2>Poppet Origins</h2>\n<p>It's rare to find two poppets that look alike, but the most significant and defining characteristic of a poppet isn't what they're made of. Rather, it's how they were imbued with life and independent thought. Magic animates most poppets, and those awakened gain their spark of life and sentience when something goes slightly off‑kilter with their enchantment. For unknown reasons-perhaps an accident or a creator's errant tinkering-a spark of life explodes into being, and a formerly lifeless series of nested commands and calculations synthesize together as true thought. The poppet suddenly gains life and self‑awareness, the ability to speak and reason, and a desire for freedom.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a poppet's life essence originally belonged to another being. An errant fragment of a departed soul, psychic impression, or similar ephemeral sliver lodges within the little construct, and the poppet's magic fashions an entirely unique personality around it. A poppet awakened this way might have occasional glimpses into the being who donated this essence, but their life, mind, and soul are thereafter their own.</p>\n<p>The rarest, and perhaps most precious, poppets are brought to life with love. These are faithful assistants or beloved toys that someone earnestly, honestly wished would become \"real.\" There's more magic in the world than found in formulas and litanies, and this wish magic awakens poppets in the best of circumstances: knowing they're cherished and able to respond with love of their own.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Poppet Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Dexterity</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "name": "Ratfolk",
          "text": "<p>Ysoki are beings that most surface-dwelling humanoids refer to as \"ratfolk.\" They are a communal people who prefer cramped conditions, with up to 100 individuals living in a given home. If they can't find homes in town, ratfolk may instead live in caves and cavern complexes, as these provide great storage for the many and varied goods they bring back from trading expeditions.</p>\n<p>Ratfolk love to travel, and they can often be found on the road in merchant caravans. They're good with their hands and have a keen eye for spotting anything out of the ordinary, from threats to treasures. They're also inveterate hoarders; ysoki warrens are crammed full of unusual odds and ends gathered by previous generations and stowed away in preparation for some future emergency.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is smart, fast, welltraveled, and adaptable, try playing a ratfolk!</p>\n<h2>You might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have pride in your large extended family, and stay in contact with everyone in it.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Like to travel near and far in search of new experiences, likely collecting trinkets along the way</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are surprised by your careful grooming and other fastidious habits.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Think you're crowding them and invading their personal space.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Ratfolk have whiskered snouts, large ears, and hairless tails, and typically have red eyes and short brown or black fur. A common ratfolk is 4 feet tall and weighs around 80 pounds. Ratfolk vary considerably, however; even a single family group can exhibit substantial variation in hair color, eye color, or size.</p>\n<p>Instinct drives ratfolk to maintain cleanliness, though this is also reinforced through their strong social structures. Because their appearance is often considered disturbing by other humanoids—and people may even mistake them for wererats—ratfolk often conceal their physical features with layers of clothing when moving through spaces dominated by other ancestries.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Ysoki culture values cooperation and community. Every ratfolk learns—through communal games, social occasions, and sports—to forge fast friendships and connections with ratfolk outside their family. With a long tradition of working as traders and tinkers, ratfolk travel frequently from one town to another. Their wagons are usually grouped into caravans of up to half a dozen vehicles. Ysoki wagons are pulled by exceptionally large giant rats, and many ratfolk can speak to such animals.</p>\n<p>Every ysoki family has perhaps two dozen names that have been passed down from generation to generation, sometimes with minor alterations or alternative nicknames. Ratfolk are often assigned nicknames and sobriquets by humanoids they interact with, but most find these names distasteful and endure them only when outside their communities.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Barnan, Chikis, Chonan, Deto, Jass, Jix, Knagi, Kubi, Lolo, Ninnec, Nos, Rak, Renzi, Skigim, Tali, Zess</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Ratfolk care more about their family than abstract concepts of good and evil. Their warrens might be chaotic dens filled with hoarded knickknacks, but they also obey strict social codes.</p>\n<p>Though ratfolk revere their ancestors and tend to acknowledge whatever deity is prevalent in their local area, Lao Shu Po has a special role in ysoki culture. Grandmother Rat embodies many things that are otherwise antithetical to ratfolk—she urges followers to put their own interests above others.

        "Samsaran": {
          "name": "Samsaran",
          "text": "<p>Samsarans, as the tale goes, originated with a group of scholars in Zi Ha who ventured into the mountains to find the cure for an illness ravaging their village. After weeks of peril, they found a freshwater spring filled with pure magical life essence. This water brought the scholars back from the brink of death and cured the villagers. Given a new chance at life, everyone who drank the water devoted the rest of their life to learning and experiencing the world fully. Upon death, this devotion, combined with the magical essence now infused in their bodies, transformed these people into the first samsarans.</p>\n<p>Samsarans dedicate themselves to achieving enlightenment—a true understanding of everything and everyone in the world around and beyond them. Unlike duskwalkers, samsarans reincarnate many times over, with some accumulating thousands of lived lives. This cycle of reincarnation continues until the individual samsaran achieves this goal of enlightenment, or irrevocably fails at making any progress toward it. At that time, a samsaran's soul passes onto the Great Beyond, and their body melts into pure water. For those samsarans who succeeded at enlightenment, they find a time of peace and satisfaction in the afterlife. Those who have failed instead encounter an afterlife filled with misery, punishment, reminders of past failure, or in extreme cases, nothing, leaving the souls to waste away for the rest of time.</p>\n<p>While samsarans can recall parts of their past incarnations, these recollections often feel like halfremembered dreams. By combining these snippets of memories from the past with new knowledge from their current life span, samsarans can view and connect with the world in entirely unique ways. The detachment that comes with countless lifetimes sometimes makes it difficult for samsarans to empathize and connect with others, however.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who experiences a repeated cycle of existence, seeking out new knowledge and experiences as you walk a path to learning everything you can about the universe, you should play a samsaran.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Be single-minded toward a goal to complete the next step of your enlightenment.</li>\n<li>Have a deep sense of curiosity for other people and their perspectives.</li>\n<li>Take things at a slower pace, putting things off until the next cycle of reincarnation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think that you're very knowledgeable and wise.</li>\n<li>Assume that you're deeply spiritual and detached from worldly matters.</li>\n<li>Consider you immortal and envy your ability to reincarnate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Samsarans reflect the diversity of whatever ancestry they had in their first mortal life cycle, and only upon their first rebirth do they take on the unique features of their kind. The reincarnation cycle gives samsarans blue skin tones, often in a pale shade but ranging to the deepest midnight navy as well. They have pupilless eyes that are typically pallid in coloration, comparable to the moon. Samsarans also have transparent and colorless blood, resembling crystal clear water.</p>\n<p>When samsarans die, they reincarnate as a baby born to a humanoid couple of non-samsaran ancestry, often in the area a particular samsaran held the most affinity for in their previous life cycle. While they might share some features with their previous incarnation, the similarity is more like the shared appearances between a parent and child rather than identical duplication. Samsarans age at the same rate as humans, and unless they succumb to unnatural causes of death, they die of old age at 100 years old. Children born to samsarans live their first life cycle as the mortal ancestry their parents had and will take on the unique skin color and eyes of other samsarans only after their first death.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The ultimate goal for samsarans is to reach enlightenment, but there's no singular path to walk or prescribed way to do so. Rather, each samsaran must explore the universe and learn its many secrets in their own way. Some samsarans find their way into schools, where they study niche research topics for decades at a time. Others act in the service of different gods, each religion offering them guidance to understanding the universe. Many enter periods of long internal reflection, isolating themselves from the outside world, while a handful venture out into the world to experience everything firsthand. From one incarnation to another, a samsaran can also switch up their path, pursuing a new avenue of knowledge and experience than they'd done for the last few centuries.</p>\n<p>Even with the independent nature of the path to enlightenment, samsarans don't necessarily go through their journeys alone. Samsarans value community as spaces to share knowledge, find support and safety, and establish a connection with similarly minded people. Samsaran communities are often tightly knit, and their enclaves small. With a focus on knowledge and connection to the world, these samsaran enclaves typically occur in schools and temples. Trusted non-samsarans are invited into these communities to share their expertise and to learn from the collective knowledge of samsarans in different stages of the enlightenment journey. Conflicting perspectives and experiences are welcome, with samsarans encouraged to talk through differences to come to a better combined understanding.</p>\n<p>When samsarans travel outside of their enclaves, they often live nomadically until they find something they want to study. If their journey takes them to a non-samsaran community, they might spend several cycles learning and experiencing life within that community, lending their knowledge to the people there and becoming a member until the call of enlightenment leads them away.</p>\n<p>Rarely do samsarans have children, but when they do, the child isn't born a samsaran. Rather, the child bears the ancestry of their parents before they too reincarnated into samsarans, such as a human child born to samsarans who were human in their first life. Thus, it's tradition for children of samsaran lineage who haven't gone through their first rebirth to be adopted by nonsamsaran communities and experience a fully mortal life. This practice isn't done out of cruelty or neglect; most samsarans believe that spending this first lifetime among one's kin is a fundamental element that can never be properly experienced after reincarnation. Some samsarans do choose to raise their children themselves, but they usually keep members of their child's ancestry as close friends to maintain the important connection in this first lifetime. Regardless of their upbringing, once the child dies and reincarnates for the first time, their parents will traditionally bring the child into a samsaran community to begin their path to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>While a core part of a samsaran's identity is preserved in the reincarnation cycle, their gender, appearance, and perspectives change from incarnation to incarnation. Even with memories shared between life cycles, when a samsaran is reborn, they're treated as a different individual than their previous incarnations.</p>\n<p>For samsarans, the journey is the destination, so they don't rush through their lifetimes trying to reach enlightenment as quickly as possible. Every incarnation, a samsaran usually focuses on a goal that will further their understanding of the world. However, if the goal isn't accomplished in one lifetime, it gets carried over into the next reincarnation cycle, with some goals lasting several hundred years. The blending of lifetimes combined with the fact that the reincarnation cycle continues indefinitely until enlightenment is achieved—or failed—gives samsarans a skewed sense of time. With as many lifetimes as they could possibly need to accomplish or undo anything they want, urgency isn't a common concept for samsarans.</p>\n<p>Samsaran names are shaped both by their previous incarnations and their present one. Their first names are given to them by the parents who raised them in their current life cycle and therefore reflect the region and culture where they're reborn. Upon reaching adulthood, samsarans give themselves a second name that reflects what they learned in their previous incarnation or represents their goal for this life cycle, such as virtues they hope to embody or concepts they wish to better understand. Most samsarans don't use traditional surnames, but if they wish to have one, they often combine the names from their last two incarnations.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Altuin Nurture, Davare Clarity, Enkhma Defense, Jochi Spellcrafter, Narintya Softheart, Sarange Lawseeker</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>With their lives centered around seeking enlightenment and the laws of the reincarnation cycle, many samsarans tend toward structure and order, tempered by compassion and empathy drawn from existences spent in a variety of bodies. A samsaran's beliefs can also change between incarnations, with the experiences of the previous lifetime impacting their worldviews in the current one.</p>\n<p>Many samsarans are drawn toward religion and deities, which provide community and a framework to understanding the world that helps guide their path to enlightenment. With each samsaran's path being so independently unique, samsarans might follow any of a wide variety of gods in any given lifetime. However, Tsukiyo is often cited as the patron god of samsarans since many samsarans feel kinship toward his own tale of rebirth and the eternal cycle of the moon. Some tales even suggest that Tsukiyo had blessed the magical springs the first samsarans drank from.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>achieve greater self-understanding, find your personal path toward enlightenment, take your time on journeys</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>live without intention or purpose, prevent others from genuine attempts at learning, stagnate in thought or passion</p>\n<h2>Samsaran Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon, Common in Zi Ha, Po Li, and Goka</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Samsaran, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

        "Sarangay": {
          "name": "Sarangay",
          "text": "<p>Sarangay are carabao-headed people who have long survived deep in the forests across Tian Xia. Many adventurers have thought them to be monsters at first, but sarangay are nothing more than a thriving society who value their community and their souls above all else. Their cultures are built upon the intense desire to protect their communities and their chosen leader. Their horns are said to be a crescent moon, and their towering statures are said to have come from their ancestors being stretched so far up to reach their Father Moon while their Mother Earth kept them close to her bosom. They revere the great Father Moon, their First Ancestor, and endeavor to protect and exalt nature above all else, for they understand that they're part of it.</p>\n<p>Sarangay tend to be rare and appear even rarer within the diverse confines of adventuring cities. When they leave their society, it's typically because they either have a duty to fulfill or they must depart in order to save their community. In the rising chaos of the modern lands of Tian Xia, more sarangay have begun to venture out into the world, either preemptively investigating potential threats or facing a breakdown in their own societies. The most tragic sarangay are those who wander alone because they have nothing and no one to protect and care for.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is at home in the wild, possesses inherent occult power, is sharply aware of their impressive strength, and comes from a proud culture, you should play a sarangay.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<p>Show off your head gem to loved ones but hide it from those that you don't trust.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exalt a warrior culture that focuses on protecting what's yours as well as the forests and lands around your settlements.</li>\n<li>Be overly protective of those you care about, even to violent ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are circumspect about the topic of your head gem, either out of empathetic respect or scheming greed.</li>\n<li>Trust your word when you say you would protect the ones you love.</li>\n<li>Underestimate just how gentle you can be when it comes to those you care for.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Sarangay are tall warriors with humanoid bodies that almost always have naturally heavy builds. They average at about 6 to 7 feet tall and have visibly muscular physiques—sarangay very often describe humans and similarly built ancestries as \"slender\" due to the difference between their typical figures. Their eyes are black orbs with white crescents for pupils. They have large, clawed hands, while their legs end in hooves that have the capacity to topple trees. Sarangay reach adulthood when their horns reach 2 feet in length. Their jewelry tends to include large horn platings, nose rings, and excessively large bangles made of gold common in the forests where sarangay live.</p>\n<p>From birth, every sarangay has a giant gleaming stone upon their brow known as their head gem, which houses their soul. When sarangay choose a partner, they switch their head gems with each other and are in love for the rest of their lives. Unsurprisingly, sarangay are belligerent against anyone who would steal these gems. Unfortunately, the size, quality, and rarity of the head gems give them a staggering market value, and their spiritual associations attract unscrupulous magicians.</p>\n<p>Callous nobles of Tian Xia love to carve such gems into decorations or display the gems upon their desks and in their lavish living areas.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Sarangay are strong individually, but together, they're considered unbeatable. Most sarangay communities are small villages deep within the forests, but they demonstrate the same amount of diversity as the other ancestries of Tian Xia. These settlements are built out of houses that can be easily destroyed and remade; these residences can be moved with the shifting seasons and tides, to avoid invaders and other threats, and to uphold the proper geomancy of a village. The center of a village is always the house of the village chief, usually known as the datu, or sometimes ratu. The datu's house is known as the kraton, a large multi-storied palace made of the best hardwood, lacquered and oiled, making it less disposable than the other houses.</p>\n<p>The datu is surrounded in their daily lives by their closest companions, usually either their own kin or a coterie of vassals who are indebted to the datu and are obliged to fight as the datu's own warband of faithful knights. Those sarangay related to the datu are often known as nobles, and they can take on any profession of their liking. The rest of the village is made up of commoners who do a large amount of the work for the village. They render a part of their labor to the datu in return for the protection and prestige of the datu's stewardship. This hierarchy isn't mandated by some divinity, but rather out of respect for a worthy leader. Datu who are deemed unworthy by the rest of the village are often overthrown by the concerted efforts of the commoners, who then choose a better datu, who can even come from their own ranks.</p>\n<p>Sarangay hold their gleaming head gems in the highest regard, for the gems are said to contain their souls and all their memories. If a sarangay's gem is destroyed, it can regrow through the help of a shaman's ritual, but the gem-less sarangay falls into a state of dreamless stupor until then. Entire warbands are formed in villages to protect against poachers and adventurers who would steal head gems to achieve untold riches.</p>\n<p>Sarangay usually have names that are two to three syllables long and that are usually one or two words, depending on the cadence. They tend to have consonants paired together to create hard yet regal sounds that exalt the ancient tongue and names of their ancestors.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Dakal, Davvun, Karatallu, Kasta, Kunnasi, Makkan Vulan, Mangi Yavu, Mappia, Nallutu, Ngatta, Nikanni, Sikamu, Tadday, Tullung, Uzzin, Vulu Vvuga</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Despite their inherent occult powers, sarangay are very attuned to the forces of nature and the rhythms of wild places. They particularly hold the moon, which they call Ama Vulan—Father Moon—in the highest regard. Sarangay believe their horns represent the moon in its crescent phase, and their head gem is the moon at its fullest. During the full moon, sarangay perform intricate rituals to earn merit and favor from Father Moon, whom they believe to be their First Ancestor. Other than Father Moon and Mother Earth, they pay proper reverence to the thousand little gods who live in the leaves, in the droplets of water, in the embers of a bonfire. Sarangay believe that nature is inherently divine and alive, living much like they do.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>protect what's yours, seek to understand the duality of the earth and moon, spend time enjoying the rhythms of nature</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>betray a worthy leader, remove your head gem without good cause</p>\n<h2>Sarangay Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaws</strong> Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

When casting any spell or ritual to return you to life, your intact head gem can be substituted for your body. While you can freely remove your head gem, it's typically impossible for another creature to forcibly remove or destroy your head gem unless you're killed or permanently incapacitated first; at the GM's discretion, powerful magic or abilities can circumvent this restriction. If your head gem is removed or destroyed, it can be regrown using a day-long ritual. When this occurs, any remains of the previous gem immediately crumble to dust.</p>\n<h2>Sarangay Heritages</h2>\n<p>Sarangay have existed throughout Tian Xia for ages, and their clans are named for the phases of the moon.

          "name": "Schisk",
          "text": "<p><em>Shisks are secretive mountain-dwellers, bone-feathered humanoids who lurk underground in dark tunnels and caverns. Their fascination with collecting and protecting esoteric knowledge is one of the few things that can persuade them to explore the outside world.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Shisks rarely encounter other peoples, even in the Mwangi Expanse. Shisks subsist on low-calorie diets of vegetables and insects, causing them to rarely compete with others for resources or seek out people to trade. They have a tight-knit society, wary of outsiders, though they don't outright attack visitors. Their history is passed down verbally and musically, and they rarely maintain written records in order to keep their knowledge safe. Often the only proof that shisks exist comes from explorers finding signs of their architecture: organic and low-impact adobe buildings carved out of mountains rather than built atop them.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>See yourself as a part of nature and avoid taking anything you don't need.</li>\n<li>Be wary of others getting one over on you by tricking you into revealing something.</li>\n<li>Love warmth and enjoy sunbathing despite your subterranean nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are concerned by your diet and how little you eat.</li>\n<li>Become confused or annoyed by your refusal to give information freely.</li>\n<li>Appreciate your incredible memory and knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Shisks have features and skin-tones similar to humans, usually ranging from deep tan to deep black. They are lighter than their body size might indicate, due to having hollow bones. Shisks have no body hair-instead, their backs are covered in vestigial plumage that now grow only as bony quills that resemble calcified pin feathers. Though shisks can't fly, these spines are longer around their arms, as if they once had wings. A shisk's eyes contract into slits in the sunlight and are typically warmly colored, from hazel and brown to more unique colors like red or amber. Shisks have two prominent narrow fangs as the front teeth on their upper jaw, causing some people to mistake them for asanbosams or vampires.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Though rarely encountered, shisks are willing to speak, host, and trade with outsiders. Their economy might be confusing to others: they greatly eschew materialism in favor of information and the arts. They freely give away material goods for knowledge or even performances, considering themselves on the \"winning\" side of a bargain if people are willing to take material things in exchange for valuable information. They never give away information for material goods, only for other knowledge, and they rarely ask for material goods in trades.</p>\n<p>Shisk are so paranoid that different communities of shisks have been known to clash with one another over secrets. Wars are fought not over territory or resources, but over coveted information. On a few occasions, when shisk sages or diplomats convinced different groups of shisks to put aside their differences and collaborate, great puzzles and mysteries of Golarion have been solved in a matter of hours.</p>\n<p>Shisk clothing is loose and breathable, and often minimal to avoid catching on their bony feathers. Due to their society's disregard for materialism, the shisk live in great harmony with nature around them, taking only what they need. Shisk often take up simple hobbies, such as sunbathing.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Seeing themselves as part of the natural world and typically focused on their own pursuits instead of society, most shisks adopt neutral alignments. Some shisks are patrons of gods that have been long forgotten. Many shisks worship the sun god Chohar, a fact which might seem odd for people who dwell underground. The Green Faith is highly common among shisks, but when seeking out personal gods to revere, most shisks prefer gods of knowledge and secrets such as Irez, Nethys, or Norgorber.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Shisk names are usually granted by their parents, though these names often have secret meanings known only to their families.

          "text": "<p>Schunis sind kleine Humanoide, die kleinen, gedrungenen, auf zwei Beinen laufenden Hunden ähneln und manchmal für schwache und engstirnige Pazifistengehalten werden. Dank ihres schieren Durchhaltevermögens, ihrer unglaublichen Arbeitsmoral und der geschickten Nutzung von Diplomatie sind Schunis jedoch alles andere als hilflos.</p>\n<p>Den Erzählungen der Schunis zufolge wurde ihre Art von Aroden erschaffen, um ihm Gesellschaft zu leisten, kurz nachdem er die Insel Kortos erschaffen hatte. Die gesamte Schunikultur wurzelt in diesem Mythos und seinen Implikationen und erklärt so den weit verbreiteten Ruf der Abstammung, gastfreundlich, gutmütig und friedfertig zu sein. Krieg steht im krassen Gegensatz zur Lebensweise der Schunis; sie verlassen sich auf Kooperation und Beharrlichkeit, um sich in einer Welt zurechtzufinden, die hin und wieder versessen darauf zu sein scheint, sie zu vernichten. Schunis haben einen unerschütterlichen Optimismus und sehen stets das Beste in ihrem Gegenüber, selbst wenn sie immer wieder von Unterwerfung und Ausnutzung heimgesucht werden, die in anderen Gesellschaften für Bitterkeit und Fremdenfeindlichkeit sorgen würden. Für Schunis ist Friede immer ein Ziel, das es Wert ist, angestrebt zu werden, und jeder Bösewicht kann ihrer Ansicht nach Wiedergutmachung leisten. Aus diesem Grund versuchen sie stets, Probleme friedlich zu lösen.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>für jene kämpfen, die dir am Herzen liegen und danach streben, das Richtige zu tun</li>\n<li>hart und beharrlich auf ein von dir ins Auge gefasstes entferntes Ziel hinarbeiten</li>\n<li>jenen in Not mit Zuspruch, dem Nötigsten an Nahrung sowie Kameradschaft begegnen</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Andere könnten...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>dich aufgrund deiner Erscheinung süß finden oder aber vor dir zurückschrecken</li>\n<li>dich vor angsteinflößenden Situationen oder schrecklichen Phänomenen beschützen wollen - entweder aus Freundschaft oder Überfürsorglichkeit</li>\n<li>dich für deinen Pragmatismus und deine natürliche Fähigkeit schätzen, dich um andere zu kümmern</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Körperliche Beschreibung</h2>\n<p>Schunis sind gedrungene, pelzige Humanoide mit flachen hundeartigen Gesichtern und feuchten, schwarzen Augen. Ihr Fell kann eine ganze Bandbreite von Farbtönen und Mustern besitzen, wobei die meisten Schuni rehbraunes oder schwarzes Fell haben. Schunis haben kurze, geringelte Schwänze, mit denen sie manchmal unfreiwillig wedeln, wenn sie zufrieden, besonders aufgeregt oder vergnügt sind. Wie alle Hundeartigen können Schunis nicht schwitzen; sie hecheln, um Hitze und Anstrengung zu kompensieren, und es kommt häufig vor, dass man einen Schuni mit einer ständig heraushängenden Zunge sieht.</p>\n<p>Schunis erreichen das Erwachsenenalter mit etwa 8 bis 10 Jahren und selbst die Dorfältesten erreichen selten ein Alter von mehr als 50 Jahren. Nur wenig unterscheidet männliche und weibliche Schuni - außer natürlich in den späten Phasen von Schwangerschaften. Wenn Schunis altern, entwickeln beide Geschlechter gleichermaßen graues Gesichtsfell, faltige Haut und anfällige Gelenke. Ein durchschnittlicher Schuni ist ungefähr 1,05 m groß und wiegt 100 Pfund.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Obwohl die Schuni ein Leben in der Gemeinschaft anstreben, sind die meisten ihrer Siedlungen Bauerndörfer mit weniger als hundert Bewohnern. Schunis arbeiten hart, um ihre Land ertragreich zu machen und erkennen, dass sich eine große, dichte Bevölkerung negativ auf das Ökosystem auswirkt. Angriffe von Monstern, Naturkatastrophen und die Ausnutzung durch stärkere Kulturen sorgen dafür, die Ausbreitung der Schuni in der Region der Inneren See zu begrenzen.</p>\n<p>Trotz ihrer kurzen Lebensspanne sind Schuni unbeschwerte Leute mit einer kaum unterdrückbaren Liebe für das Land und ihre Schunigefährten. Sie bleiben selbst unter den schlimmsten Bedingungen optimistisch. Die einfachen Freuden des Lebens in einer wunderbaren Welt, harte Arbeit und sich mit geliebten Freunden zu umgeben motiviert Schunis, sich durch alle Widrigkeiten zu kämpfen, die sie allzu oft befallen.</p>\n<h2>Gesinnung und Religion</h2>\n<p>Die meisten Schunigemeinschaften fördern Empathie und Loyalität, so dass sie selten böse sind. Gleichzeitig sind sie pragmatisch, traditionsverliebt und scheu. Die meisten Schuniabenteurer sind Neutral Gut oder Rechtschaffen Gut. Religion ist ein Grundpfeiler des dörflichen Lebens der Schuni; sie verehren hauptsächlich Aroden - oder taten dies zumindest bis zu seinem kürzlichen Tod. In seiner Abwesenheit haben viele Schunis Erastil als ihre Schutzgottheit angenommen, da seine Schwerpunkte Familie, Gemeinschaft und Leben im Einklang mit der Natur gut zu den typischen Werten der Schuni passen. Adelige Schunis - insbesondere Krieger - wenden sich manchmal Iomedae zu. Sie dient ihnen als Vorbild für Integrität, harte Arbeit und Opferbereitschaft.</p>\n<h2>Namen</h2>\n<p>Bei ihren starken Familienbanden und dem hohen Stellenwert von Freundschaften ist es kein Wunder, dass Schunis einen gewissen Stolz dabei empfinden, ihre Kinder nach engen Freunden zu benennen. Schuninamen sind kurz, klingen kehlig und wirken für Angehörige anderer Abstammungen oft wie lose aneinandergereihte Vokale und weiche Konsonanten. Schuni finden Namen wichtig und geben sich viel Mühe, die korrekte Aussprache der Namen ihrer Freunde zu lernen und auszusprechen.</p>\n<h3>Beispielnamen</h3>\n<p>Ahogo, Arnbin, Bighmor, Bondin, Domwurd, Ebmeur, Gopor, Gurna, Hiemgur, Mufurlo, Oriog, Pulumar, Raliamar, Ruggion, Uhulrig, Ungrin.</p>\n<h2>Spielmechanik</h2>\n<p><strong>Trefferpunkte</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Größe</strong> Klein</p>\n<p><strong>Bewegungsrate</strong> 25 Fuß/7,50 m</p>\n<p><strong>Attributsverbesserungen</strong> Geschicklichkeit, Charisma, Frei</p>\n<p><strong>Attributsschwäche</strong> Konstitution</p>\n<p><strong>Sprachen</strong> Gemeinsprache, Schunisch</p>\n<p><strong>Weitere Sprachen</strong> entsprechend deines Intelligenzbonus aus Gnomisch, Goblinisch, Halblingisch, Terral, Zwergisch und sonstigen Sprachen, zu denen du Zugang hast (z.B. den regionalen Sprachen deiner Heimat).</p>\n<p><strong>Sinne</strong> Dämmersicht</p>\n<p><strong>Stumpfe Schnauze</strong> Deine kleine, flache Schnauze und dein komplex verzweigtes Sinus-System machen dich Widerstandsfähig gegenüber Phänomenen, die die Nase angreifen.

          "name": "Skelett",
          "text": "<p><em>Skeletons are considered among the lowest types of undead. They're typically mindless creatures, lacking many of the abilities that make other undead a serious threat. However, the animated bones of dragons, giants, and other great beasts make for dangerous foes. Powerful living creatures can retain some of their might and intellect upon returning as a skeleton. Some necromancers turn their strongest enemies into skeletal undead servants, assuming they can keep control of them.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Skeleton adventurers were usually skilled and powerful in their former lives. Through unremitting force of will or extraordinary circumstances, their ego and ideals persist even in death. However, the very act of rising as a skeletal undead is traumatic. Memories of one's former life are usually fractured or hazy, if anything can be remembered at all. For some, these memories return with time; for others, they're gone forever. For the most part, this comes down to how the skeleton views themself: either as a continuation of the person they once were, or an entirely new being.</p>\n<p>Skeleton adventurers often set themselves apart from other skeletons by dressing as flamboyantly as their station allows. Large, feathered caps, ornate armor, embroidered silks, or glittering jewelry are likely staples of their wardrobe. Some carve intricate \"tattoos\" into their bones or paint their skulls to maintain a sense of self that simple skeletons lack, and to signal to the living they're not like other undead.</p>\n<p>Skeleton adventurers must come to terms with their new identity. They aren't bound by the limitations of the living and are often underestimated.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Work harder than most to prove you're a capable and distinct individual.</li>\n<li>Wade into danger with little regard for the safety of your undead body.</li>\n<li>Desperately seek the acceptance of the society you once moved through with ease.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you're the servant of a necromancer, working to advance their agenda.</li>\n<li>Have difficulty empathizing with you.</li>\n<li>Regard your undeath with either pity or envy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Aside from their complete lack of flesh and organs, skeletons vary widely in appearance, reflecting the broad diversity of all living beings. They can be tall, short, or anywhere in between. Skeletons of creatures with horns, wings, or tails retain them, although they are usually useless in their skeletal state. Skeletons raised from fresh remains tend to have stark white bones, while older ones tend to be gray or yellowed. Skeletons who adventure for a while often possess faint lines crisscrossing their bones like scars, indicating where they were injured in previous battles.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Across Golarion, intelligent skeletons rarely gather in large enough numbers to constitute any kind of settlement. Even in Geb, where their numbers are highest, they typically mingle with other undead rather than band together. Many skeletons would rather keep company with those who remind them of their former life (although such reminders can just as easily lead to revulsion derived by the void energy infused within them). Gebbite skeletons are usually treated as members of the servant class and rarely have any upward social mobility.</p>\n<p>Outside Geb, skeletons are far more solitary. Some might hide on the outskirts of society or move about in disguise, but it's difficult for them to find acceptance among the living. While they may not be feared in places like Nidal or Sekamina, they're also not likely to be respected.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and religion</h2>\n<p>While undead are almost always evil, some intelligent skeletons manage to stave off the corruption of the void energy that powers them. Other than the tendency to become twisted toward evil over time, skeletons typically lean toward the alignments of their creators or their former selves. Skeletons without any particular loyalty or allegiance trend toward neutral evil alignment, or neutral if they can stave off evil.</p>\n<p>Skeletons who embrace their undeath often worship gods of death, such as Urgathoa, while those who resent it typically look toward gods of life and redemption. Accepting deities without particularly zealous anti-undead dogma, such as Shelyn, are popular among those who wish to fight against their destructive influences and become something greater than the purpose for which they were created.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>No widespread naming convention exists for skeletons. When necromancers bother to name skeletons they've raised, they typically choose names that suit their own tastes, the way one would name a pet. Others might be named for their role or job. Skeletons with their memories intact might choose to keep their name from when they were alive, but others might choose new names based on their undead experiences.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Clatterjaw, Creaker, Doorstop, Final Sacrifice, Gochiyo, Lectern, Macefodder, Sixth Lancer, Skulldyr, Xelim</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Skeleton Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Necril</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "text": "<p><em>Sprites are diminutive, whimsical, and exuberant creatures from the fey realm known as the First World. They love playing pranks, exploring new things, and embracing everything to do with magic.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When most people picture a fey, chances are they're thinking of a sprite. The majority of sprites remain in the First World, where they are essentially immortal, reincarnating to a new form of fey when their life eventually comes to an end. Some even meld together with others to form a more substantial body or split apart into multiple smaller fey. However, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms of magic, leading a significant number to risk the mortal world to explore the new possibilities offered by the unusually static nature of mortal existence. These creatures mix in with other, smaller groups of Material Plane comrades, including exiles from the First World, those whose family swore pacts to mortals, and even contemplative individuals curious to enter the mortal cycle of souls.</p>\n<p>The first generation of Material Plane sprites were content to guard magical locations or objects, learn music, and play pranks on the unsuspecting. Panic struck when children born in the mortal world didn't form wings upon adulthood-some sprites transitioning to the mortal world likewise lost their wings after a time. Believing this to be a sign that the mortal world was too alien for them to live there, many of the initial sprite explorers returned to the safety of the First World.</p>\n<p>However, their wingless children exhibited a potential unmatched by any of their ancestors, as well as a particular magical affinity for the mortal world. They became the mightiest of sprite heroes, but also, on occasion, the most dangerous villains. As they came close to reaching their full strength, many of them did grow their wings at long last: larger, unique, and more vibrant than any from the First World had seen before, a sign of their limitless potential.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is tiny, mercurial, and curious, you should play a sprite.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Play good-natured pranks on those around you, intended to teach a lesson, aid in locating a lost item, or even help find love.</li>\n<li>Become sidetracked by something new and eye-catching before you have fully followed through on your previous plan.</li>\n<li>Find something magical that's so important to you, you can't help but protect it with every ounce of your strength.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Expect you to know strange fey mysteries and perform fantastical primal magic well beyond your actual abilities.</li>\n<li>Consider you the prime suspect whenever unexplained hijinks or serendipity comes their way.</li>\n<li>Misconstrue the way your mind works, seeing your flitting attention as a sign of being scatterbrained.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Sprites are tiny faeries whose features vary wildly based on their heritage. The Wingless-those with the potential to become powerful heroes and villains, including all PC sprites-slowly grow their wings over time as their magical potential manifests, though some never grow wings at all. Those sprites with humbler destinies typically grow wings when reaching full adulthood and mastering their innate magic. Sprites reach adulthood at around the same rate as humans do, but a typical fey who can manage to stay out of mischief and danger can live 1,000 years or more. Material Plane sprites who sense their time is coming to an end usually return to the First World to be reborn and start their adventure all over again.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Sprites habitually live in tiny, reclusive villages in areas with abundant magic, natural beauty, or other curiosities of interest. Other sprites live as loners or with small family or peer groups, traveling across the land in search of excitement.</p>\n<h2>Alignments and Religion</h2>\n<p>Sprites run the gamut of alignments but are rarely lawful or evil. They are far more likely to worship the Eldest-the peculiar deities of the fey-than those of the mortal world. They have a particular affinity for Shyka, the many-formed Eldest of time, and the Lantern King, the trickster among their ranks. Among mortal deities, sprites appreciate Desna the most, and due to her iconic depiction as a butterfly-winged woman, some Desnan sprites claim her as one of their own. Sprites also readily comprehend the doctrines of Cayden Cailean and Shelyn, and the goddess of beauty and art is a particular favorite among grigs.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Sprite names are based entirely on their parents' whimsy. Sprites often adopt additional monikers later in life or change those assigned to them at birth; this is neither frowned upon nor considered abnormal.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Bree, Plumgrass, Cowrie, Flit, Moth, Zephyr, Naatalu, Pinebrush, Zandivar</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Sprite Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Tiny</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Strength</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Sylvan</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "name": "Strix",
          "text": "<p><em>Known as itarii in their own language, strix are reclusive avian humanoids devoted to their homelands and their tribes. They defend their precious communities with broad wingspans and razor talons.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Strix value ferocity, vengeance, and devotion above all else. Their dark, formidable wingspans and long history of taking revenge for their fallen family members have painted them as winged devils in the eyes of neighboring human populations. In contradiction to their misunderstood nature, strix boast a spiritual, artistic, and compassionate culture that is rarely seen outside of their roosts.</p>\n<p>As strix populations begin to resurge and spread beyond the mountainous region known as the Devil's Perch, their tribes now speckle the landscape of Cheliax and surrounding nations. Soaring over mountains, forests, and beaches, strix are always brought home by the deep connections they share with their kinfolk.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is loyal yet enigmatic, fierce yet artistic, and who yearns to soar above the world, you should play a strix.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dedicate and endear yourself to your family, friends, or community.</li>\n<li>Harbor an inherited distrust of humans.</li>\n<li>Keep strangers at arm's length and perhaps exhibit naivete about the world beyond your homeland.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your dedicated friendship, even if they don't grasp the cultural history behind it.</li>\n<li>Treat you on occasion like a carrier pigeon, asking you to deliver letters or other similar favors.</li>\n<li>Find your appearance frightening due to complete inexperience with strix.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Strix are avian-influenced humanoids with intimidating talons and feathered wings sprouting from their backs. With an average height of 6 feet, strix are taller than most humans but are very light for their size. Strix are considered mature at 14 years of age and have an average lifespan of 40 years. They have pointed ears and large eyes that are typically black from sclera to pupil, but occasionally appear as a piercing golden color. Strix lack the ability to move their eyes independently of their head, resulting in distinctive jerky movements as their gaze snaps between targets. Their bodies are usually taut with defined musculature-a result of the strength necessary to flex their wings.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Strix are rare and reclusive people who cling to their ancestral territories. They live in modest-sized tribes, but some reside in smaller bands of tight-knit individuals. The largest settlements of strix reside on Devil's Perch, but a small number of their ilk have traveled far across Golarion. Strix feel an intense empathy and attachment to their family and other community members. They prioritize the needs of their community over their individual desires, and their bands and tribes benefit from an easy yet expertly organized division of labor. Strix tribes are led by a rokoa, a female tribal leader.</p>\n<p>A long history of conflict with the nearby nation of Cheliax as bred into most strix a deep fear and suspicion of humans-who they call kotaara. Strix have struggled to keep hold of their territories and maintain their numbers in the face of constant conflict with these enemies who, in addition to trying to destroy what they believe to be winged devils, vastly outnumber them. Due to their strongly bonded groups, the loss of a single tribe member is devastating.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Due to their deep respect for the rules of a functioning society, strix are rarely chaotic, but some may be flexible on adopting the rules of outside societies. Strix are typically nonreligious and instead use stories from an epic known as the Korrsat Akra, or \"The Scattered Nest,\" to tell them of their origins and give them direction on their current place in the world. They have a deep investment in the lives of their fellows and experience intense grief at their passing. Pharasma is a common influence among religious strix due to the popularity of religious and spiritual practices honoring the lives and deaths in their beloved community. Gozreh is also an everyday influence for many strix, who beseech the Wind and the Waves to give them satisfying tailwinds for flight and protect their kin when the sky turns dark with fury. Erastil and even Torag represent two versions of social order and may be unifying deities across entire tribes.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Strix names consist of sounds that are reminiscent of chirping, screeches, or trilling by various birds, and their naming conventions are influenced primarily by tradition and spirituality. Strix in small communities might share a common syllable among all their names to express their unity. Due to their deep affection for their family members, naming children after other loved ones is very common, occasionally with an additional syllable or slight change to the pronunciation.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Chiit-iir, Cicreeti, Ikatarii, Irkoata, Kaata, Kiilo, Kirii, Rahka, Roatatwiil, Turiilo, Turuk, Twilii</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Strix Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Strix</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

In addition, when you make a Long Jump, you can jump a distance up to 10 feet further than your Athletics check result, though still with the normal maximum of your Speed.

        "Surki": {
          "name": "Surki",
          "text": "<p>Surkis sind eine insektoide Spezies, die sich von der latenten Magie in ihrer Umwelt ernährt. Als unterirdisch in den Finsterlanden lebende Spezies hat man sie bisher kaum an der Oberfläche erblickt und es gab stets lange Pausen zwischen den Sichtungen. Dies liegt am Lebenszyklus der Surkis: Nach langen Ruhephasen legen sie große Entfernungen im Rahmen sogenannten „Generationsgrabungen“ zurück als Reaktion auf unterirdische Geschehnisse. Das Schließen der Weltenwunde hat eine der größten dieser Grabungen in ihrer Geschichte ausgelöst. Die Wanderung führte sie in die Höhlen und Tunnel der Sarkorisnarbe und von dort erstmals seit sehr vielen Jahren an die Oberfläche. Seitdem sind mehrere kleine Surkidörfer in abgelegenen Winkeln von Sarkoris entstanden, deren Bewohner eifrig und wissbegierig die Natur, die Magie und die diversen anderen Bewohner der so fremden Oberflächenumgebung katalogisieren.</p>\n<p>Surkis nehmen keine gewöhnliche Nahrung auf, sondern absorbieren Magie, welche sie aus der Luft, dem Boden, Pflanzen, Stein und nahezu allen anderen Materialien herausfiltern. Diese Magie wird veredelt und im Laufe des Lebens eines Surkis in Knoten in seinem Leib gespeichert. Der Lebenszyklus der Surkis besteht aus drei Phasen: Larve, Erwachsener und Weiterentwickelter. Zum Übergang in die jeweils nächste Phase nutzt ein Surki die in ihm gespeicherte Magie, um eine dramatische Metamorphose auszulösen und Anpassungen zu erlangen, die ihm helfen, in einer bestimmten Umgebung zu überleben. Surkis unterscheiden sich daher sehr untereinander, erzählt doch die einzigartige Kombination der Anpassungen jedes Surkis die Geschichte seiner Abenteuer und welche Rolle er für sich in einer Umgebung gewählt hat.</p>\n<p>Solltest du einen Charakter spielen wollen, der Golarion zum ersten Mal erkundet, über unbegrenzte Anpassbarkeit verfügt und eine starke Verbindung zur Magie besitzt, solltest du einen Surki spielen.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest...</h2><ul>\n<li>eine starke Verbindung zu deiner Umwelt verspüren und die latente Magie überall wahrnehmen.</li>\n<li>den Drang verspüren, in die Ferne zu reisen oder so viel wie möglich über deine Heimat zu erfahren.</li>\n<li>besonderes Interesse zeigen, wie andere in dir unvertrauten Umgebungen überleben.</li>\n</ul><h2>Andere könnten...</h2><ul>\n<li>deine Individualität und Begeisterung für deine Anpassungen als angeberischen Stolz missverstehen.</li>\n<li>deine Faszination mit neuen Leuten, Orten und Dingen liebenswert und inspirierend empfinden.</li>\n<li>in schwierigen Situationen deinen magischen Sinnen mehr vertrauen als ihren eigenen Karten.</li>\n</ul><h2>Körperliche Beschreibung</h2>\n<p>Ein Surki sieht in jeder seiner drei Lebensphasen sehr anders aus. Larven verbringen die ersten 10 bis 100 Lebensjahre schlafend in ihren Eiern und warten, bis sie genug latente Magie aufgesogen haben und die Umgebungsbedingungen passen. Eine Larve ist etwa 0,60 m lang und erinnert an eine Made; durch die durchscheinende Haut kann man mehrere leuchtende Knoten erkennen. Die Köpfe verfügen über Chitinpanzer, sind rund und augenlos – sie orientieren sich hauptsächlich mit ihrem Geruchssinn. Vier ihrer sechs Beine sind klein, aber das vordere Paar endet in großen, kräftigen Grabklauen, mit denen sie Tunnel durch den Boden graben und mit den anderen Larven ihrer Generationsgrabung kommunizieren, während sie sich immer weiter aus dem Nest entfernen. Sobald sie weit genug gereist sind, um genug Magie anzusammeln, verschwinden sie für einige Tage in Kokons. Diesen verlassen sie wieder in der Erwachsenenform, in welcher man Surkis in der Regel an der Oberfläche erblickt.</p>\n<p>Erwachsene Surkis besitzen eine grob zweibeinige Gestalt; sie stehen auf zwei Gliedmaßen mit mehreren Gelenken und verfü- gen über zwei Arme, die in dreifingrigen Klauen enden, welche sie zum Graben und für die Trommelgeräusche verwenden, aus der die Sprache der Surkis besteht. Aus der Stirn ragen zwei fedrige Antennen und links und rechts der Mandibeln befinden sich jeweils zwei lange Sensorbarteln. Der Leib eines Surkis ist abgerundet und am Rücken mit mehreren rostbraunen oder orangenen Chitinplatten gepanzert. Ihre Kleidung und Mode integrieren diese Formen und Gürtel und Riemen werden entweder über und zwischen den Platten getragen. Die Knoten, in denen sie Magie einlagern, sind über den Körper verteilt, konzentrieren sich aber im Unterleib, im Schulterbereich und in den Gliedmaßen. Auch erwachsene Surkis sammeln weiterhin Magie, um damit neue Anpassungen zu erschaffen. Solche Veränderungen werden oft durch leuchtende Muster im Chitin dort angezeigt, wo sie erfolgen werden.</p>\n<p>Die letzte Lebensphase eines Surkis ist die sogenannte Weiterentwickelte Gestalt, die im Rahmen einer umfassenden Metamorphose angenommen wird. Ein erwachsener Surki verpuppt sich und verändert sich schnell während eines einzigen Abends. Körperliche sind die Veränderungen weniger dramatisch als bei der Verwandlung von der Larven- zur Erwachsenengestalt. Die Weiterentwickelte Gestalt verfügt über magische Fähigkeiten, welche aus all den Jahren des Absorbierens magischer Energien resultieren. Die Knoten verwandeln sich in komplexe Organe, die imstande sind, spürbare Magie auf unterschiedliche Weise zu manifestieren, seien es leuchtende Flügel, die der Schwerkraft trotzen, oder Grabwerkzeuge aus reiner Kraft. Diese letzte Form ist der ultimative Ausdruck der Individualität eines Surkis und seiner Anpassungen – diese Gestalt ist perfekt für die von ihm gewählte Umgebung oder für die ihm erwählte Rolle geeignet.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Die Gesellschaft der Surkis legt sehr hohen Wert auf Individualität und Selbstausdruck. Von jedem Surki wird erwartet, dass er seinen eigenen Weg findet. Innovation ist eine hochgeschätzte Errungenschaft. Surkis sind zudem sehr mit ihrer Umgebung im Einklang: Sie unterscheiden Tier und Pflanzen nicht, sondern betrachten alle Wesen als wichtige Elemente der Umgebung. Dies führt dazu, dass ihre Dörfer die Umgebung so wenig wie möglich beeinflussen; die Surkis weben Seide um Pflanzen und Pilze, um sie dazu zu bringen, zu Wänden und Unterständen zu wachsen. Holz und andere pflanzenbasierende Ressourcen werden nur selten auf eine für den Rest der Welt traditionelle Weise geerntet, stattdessen lassen Surkis sie an strategisch gewählten Plätzen wachsen und holen sich nur genau so viel, dass die Pflanze nicht getötet wird, wenn es ihnen möglich ist.</p>\n<p>Surkische Beziehungen konzentrieren sich darauf, Adaptionen zu finden, die einander ergänzen. Surkis sind im Allgemeinen polyamorös, so dass ein Surki enge Bindungen zu zahlreichen anderen unterhalten kann. Zudem besitzen alle Surkis nur ein Geschlecht – sie verstehen zwar das Konzept von Geschlechtern und geschlechtsbezogene Konzepte, die bei anderen Abstammungen verbreitet sind, betrachten oft aber die Vorstellung absurd, keine Bindung zu jemandem wegen Anatomie oder persönlichen Beschreibungen einzugehen. Stattdessen suchen sie ihre Partner nach Persönlichkeit, Befähigungen und/oder Adaptionen aus, welche die eigenen auf unerwartete Weise ergänzen, so wie ein durch lockere Erde gegrabener Tunnel mittels gewobener Seide verstärkt werden kann. Dennoch ist dies auch in der surkischen Gesellschaft eine komplizierte Angelegenheit. Surkis in solch einer Beziehung drücken ihre Gefühle für einander oftmals in Form einer persönlichen Beschreibung dessen aus, was sie am anderen schätzen. So könnte ein Surki einen Partner als „Der ruhig spricht und meinen Boden bereichert“ vorstellen.</p>\n<p>Nur erwachsene Surkis können sich fortpflanzen; dies geschieht mittels Parthenogenese. Ein Erwachsener kann ein Ei legen, wenn er dies wünscht, verbraucht dabei aber einen Großteil der in seinem Körper gespeicherten Magie; entsprechend legen die meisten Surkis nur alle paar Jahre ein Ei. Viele Eier werden in einem beschützten Bereich des Dorfes aufbewahrt und warten auf die nächste Generationsgrabung. Sind die Eier so weit, schlüpfen die Larven als Masse und koordinieren ihre Abreise – sie werden von der Magie wie von einem Leuchtfeuer angezogen, zu dem sie sich durch Erde und Stein graben, um einen neuen Ort zum Ansiedeln zu finden.</p>\n<p>Das Familienleben der Surkis unterscheidet sich völlig von dem der meisten anderen Abstammungen. Legt ein Surki ein Ei außerhalb der Generationsgrabung, so kümmert er sich darum, bis die Larve schlüpft. Die Larve wird dann sich selbst überlassen und kann auch das Dorf verlassen oder in die Ferne aufbrechen. Die meisten finden ihr erstes Zuhause in den Gärten des Dorfes, wo sie sich von der natürlichen Magie im Boden und in den Pflanzen ernähren. Diese Gärten fungieren zugleich als Schulen, da die Erwachsenen und die Weiterentwickelten, welche die Gärten pflegen, mit den Larven sprechen und ihre Erfahrungen und was sie von anderen gehört haben, weitergeben. Frühzeitig geschlüpfte, unterentwickelte Larven und jene, deren Knoten nicht funktionieren, gehen oft eine Symbiose mit Ostillisen ein, kleinen, formlosen Symbionten, welche die Gabe der Larven stärken, aus Magie Nährstoffe zu erlangen.</p>\n<p>Ein Surki wählt seinen Namen mit dem Übergang zum Erwachsenen. Zuvor besitzt er einen „Wurzel-“ oder „Larvennamen“, der allein mit den vorderen Gliedmaßen kommuniziert wird. Erwachsene stellen ihre Wurzelnamen ganz oder teilweise ihren gewählten Namen voran, wenn sie sich vorstellen, wobei sie nicht erwarten, dass andere diese aus Klopfzeichen bestehenden Namensteile wiederholten – und schon gar nicht, sollte der jemand abstammungsbedingt nicht über das zum „Aussprechen“ nötige Exoskelett verfügen. Der Wurzelname wird zwar stolz vorgetragen, gilt aber als sein persönliches Eigentum; wird er von jemandem wiederholt, der um diesen Umstand weiß, so wird dies in der Regel als unhöflich und fast schon wie versuchter Diebstahl betrachtet. Der gewählte Erwachsenenname repräsentiert meistens eine persönliche Eigenschaft, die der Surki am meisten bewundert, oder eine Errungenschaft, die ihn mit Stolz erfüllt. Mit den Jahren könnten sich diese Ansichten ändern und mit ihnen die Namen. Sollte ein Surki sterben, werden Gegenwartsformen in seinem Namen zu Vergangenheitsformen.</p>\n<h3>Beispielnamen</h3>\n<p>Träger Schwerer Steine, Weber Faszinierender Netze, Mit der Kräftigsten Singstimme, Der Hell Erstrahlt, Dessen Muster Mutig Sind, Dessen Stimme Wie Musik Ist.</p>\n<h2>Glauben und Religion</h2>\n<p>Die Verbindung der Surkis zu ihrer Umgebung lässt sie normalerweise Gottheiten der Natur verehren. Gemäß ihren eigenen uralten Traditionen besitzt jede Kreatur eine einzigartige Seele und belegen die wichtigsten Arten in ihren Ökosystemen göttliche Rollen. Allerdings sind nach diesen Traditionen Surkis und Angehörige anderer Kulturen nicht Teil dieses Kreislaufes der Seelen – mit Zeit, Sorgfalt und Übung könnte man aber den Segen der Schlüsselarten der Umgebung erlangen und so Teil des Kreislaufes werden.</p>\n<p>In surkischen Ortschaften in Sarkoris wächst die Anhängerschaft von Gozreh und Sturovenen rasch. Folgt ein Surki einer Gottheit, wählt er eher eine, die seine Umgebung oder die Natur als Ganzes repräsentiert. Gottheiten mit der Domäne des Reisens oder der Veränderung sind ebenfalls unter surkischen Gläubigen beliebt.</p>\n<p>Surkis ist es wichtig, dass das Leben seinen natürlichen Lauf nehmen kann. Tod, Gewalt und Krieg haben allesamt einen Platz und Sinn.</p>\n<p><strong>Verbreitete Gebote</strong> Ermutige andere, ihr wahres Selbst zu finden, schütze und nähre natürliche Ökosysteme, arbeite mit anderen zusammen und fördere symbiotische Beziehungen</p>\n<p><strong>Verbreitete Anathemata</strong> Zwinge niemanden zu einer Veränderung, zu der er (noch) nicht bereit ist</p>\n<h2>Spielmechanik</h2>\n<p><strong>Seltenheit</strong> Selten</p>\n<p><strong>Trefferpunkte</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Größenkategorie</strong> Mittelgroß</p>\n<p><strong>Bewegungsrate</strong> 25 Fuß/7,50 m</p>\n<p><strong>Attributsverstärkungen</strong> Konstitution, Frei</p>\n<p><strong>Sprachen</strong> Gemeinsprache, Surki, Weitere Sprachen in Höhe deines Intelligenzbonus.

        "Tanuki": {
          "name": "Tanuki",
          "text": "<p>Tian Xia is replete with magically gifted ancestries—such as tengu, kitsune, yakshas, and yaoguai—whose powers bring them high regard and who, in turn, use their gifts for responsible ends. Tanuki aren't one of these ancestries. Instead, the shapeshifting raccoon dog–like humanoids use their powers of illusion and transformation in ways more people should: for fun! Tanuki delight in pranks and practical jokes, especially those that allow them to take the high and mighty down a notch and show them what life is like for everyone else. Where other peoples take pride in their storied histories, noble traditions, or intricate ceremonies, tanuki take pride in their simplicity and disregard for the world's many rules. Though some might claim this outlook reduces tanuki to uncouth rubes, tanuki feel it makes them more cultured; after all, one must know a rule to bend it, and one must understand a norm to break it.</p>\n<p>That being said, their laid-back natures can cause tanuki, and others, no end of trouble. Their focus on living in the moment can often mean they're brought low by a problem they could've solved earlier with little effort. At the end of the day, tanuki rarely come out on top, and even their victories tend to be mixed with small defeats or embarrassment. A tanuki bard might save the day with the power of his music, but only because he played so off-key that bandits mistook him for a fearsome ghost. Tanuki are usually just fine with such an outcome, though. There's a truth to the world that tanuki know in their bellies: that the ups and downs of life are all just a big joke, and if everyone's going to be made a fool in the end, you might as well be the fool who gets to dance and have fun along the way! Life's a party, and tanuki intend to enjoy it as much as they can before their luck inevitably runs out.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who loves to have fun—occasionally at another's or your own expense— who's always up for a party and perhaps a bit too clever for their own good, you should play a tanuki.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Live life to the absolute fullest, getting into whatever trouble that approach might bring you.</li>\n<li>Take pride in your duties and accomplishments, no matter how humble.</li>\n<li>Be accustomed to the role of underdog and take it in stride, seeing failure as a wonderful punchline.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find you the life of any party.</li>\n<li>Know you'll always have their back.</li>\n<li>Hope you aren't about to play a joke on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Tanuki are short humanoids who resemble bipedal raccoon dogs, usually growing between 3 and 4 feet tall. They tend to have rotund bodies, with large bellies that appear even wider due to their thick fur. A tanuki's face is likewise round, with wide-set, alert eyes outlined within a dark mask of fur. Tanuki have a single bushy tail that they take great pride in and to which they ascribe their powers. These qualities together give tanuki a strong cultural appreciation for rounded shapes over sharp angles, such as daruma dolls, circular doors, and the moon.</p>\n<p>Tanuki often wear simple, rustic clothing, opting for plain garb over elegant frills or shining jewels. However, tanuki are known to go all-out for festivals and similar celebrations, which they see as the perfect opportunity to enjoy life to the fullest. Many tanuki make it a point to always carry a red vest and dancing towel in case an impromptu party breaks out.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Tanuki know that, among the many people of Golarion, they're underdogs, possessing neither the mastery of the heavens that tengu command nor the divine favor that kitsune enjoy. All things considered, tanuki know they have to support each other, building tight communities where everyone knows each other's names. These communities tend to exist on the outskirts of villages, often in abandoned warehouses or farms or else near temples and other public buildings. When tanuki societies overlap with those of other peoples, they usually function unseen with their own codes of honor, rarely noticed by those in power.</p>\n<p>Tanuki love celebration and will hold any number of parties for even the smallest accomplishments—a project such as building a new bridge might have a kick-off ceremony, a toast when the plans are decided, a morale lunch when the workers have assembled, a banquet upon finishing the bridge, and a festival to dance over the bridge when it opens to the public. This proclivity is sometimes brought up as a reason for why tanuki endeavors tend to take an interminably long time (with some failing spectacularly along the way), but tanuki feel that it's important to celebrate what small victories they can. Besides, the community bonds forged among the participants are as much a part of the project as the actual building itself.</p>\n<p>Tanuki tend toward unglamorous names with functional meanings, such as those that describe a tanuki's birth order or the weather or season on the day they were born. Tanuki surnames tend to be similar, describing either their family's profession or location in a town. These conventions make tanuki names feel relatively old-fashioned, though some avant-garde tanuki give their children (or themself) a grandiose name in defiance of their traditional station.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Ame, Chiyo, Chosuke, Hinata, Mari, Nao, Saya, Taro, Terao, Rei, Ichiro, Jiro, Saburo, Shiro, Satsuki, Mutsu, Nanami, Hazuki</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Tanuki count no member of the Celestial Court among their own—a fact they see as further evidence that they have to stick up for each other since there's no tanuki deity looking out for them—but they find themselves drawn toward gods such as Kofusachi, whose boisterous and compassionate approach to life they consider aspirational. Though tanuki hold deep reverence toward the moon, they tend not to worship Tsukiyo, knowing he finds loud worship agitating, and they take care to not invoke his name or imagery during harvest moon or lunar new year celebrations to ensure their cheers and belly drums don't draw his attention. Tanuki with Inner Sea cultural traditions tend to revere Cayden Cailean, seeing the blood of a tanuki in his commoner status (and drunken accomplishments), with some tanuki statues even depicting Cayden with a big belly and leaf atop his head to suggest that he was simply a tanuki in human form, tricking the Avistani even to this day.</p>\n<p>Tanuki generally use their powers to humble the rich and snobby; at the very least, they create illusions with no more evil in their hearts than a simple joke (or a free meal taken from one who can afford it), rather than acting out of malice. However, there are some tanuki do harbor resentment, which can take root and fester in their hearts. These tanuki turn to cruel ends, known for all manner of nefarious deeds, chief among them cooking their enemies into soups or stews once they've finished tricking them.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>Choose excitement over stability, let bygones be bygones, make your community laugh</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>Feel entitled to social status, prank one of lower means than yourself, wallow in your failures</p>\n<h2>Tanuki Heritages</h2>\n<p>A tanuki's heritage reflects a unique virtue that beats in the tanuki's heart.

In maritime regions, tengu notably work as fishers, blacksmiths, and \"jinx eaters\"—members of ships' crews who are believed, accurately or otherwise, to absorb misfortune. Having lived in a variety of conditions and locations, tengu tend to be nonjudgmental, though their willingness to associate with lawbreakers has often led some to regard them with suspicion.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character hailing from a rich history of artisanship and tradition, but who happily picks up new practices as needed, you should play a tengu.</p>\n<h2>You might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Be gregarious and eager to find a flock of your own.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Voraciously absorb the practices of those around you, sometimes even forgetting where they came from.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Get confused by your simultaneous respect for and disregard of tradition.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have trouble reading your expressions or regard you with suspicion and superstition.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Tengu have many avian characteristics.

Ihre handartigen Füße und gelenkigen Leiber leisten ihnen in den Dschungelregionen, wo die meisten Vanaras leben, gute Dienste.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Die Vanaras entsprangen vor Ewigkeiten den ambitionierten Narreteien des Affengottes Ragdya. Sie sollten die Kunde von seinem Unfug verbreiten und in die Höhe loben, aber auch als sein Ba-Sadhaks dienen, als gesegnete Glücksjäger, welche den Blick ihres Schöpfers auf die grausam gehorteten Schätze sterblicher Fürsten und unsterblicher Scheusale lenken sollten. Mit ihrer Waghalsigkeit gewannen sie die Feindschaft uralter Rakschasa-Maharadschas und mit ihrem Ruhm die Verachtung des Naga-Reiches. Es brachte ihnen aber auch die Freundschaft vieler ländlicher Vudrani ein, die sie als wilde Leute und göttliche Vorzeichen betrachteten. Dies ist die Geschichte der Vanaras und ihres langen Überlebenskampfes gegen ihre vielen Gegner, seien es die Mahajanapadas des tiefen Dschungels, die Bergghats von Vudra und auch die Unfassbaren Lande selbst.</p>\n<p>Falls du einen Charakter spielen möchtest, der den Kampf zwischen Selbstverbesserung und Selbstausdruck verkörpert, solltest du einen Vanara spielen.</p>\n<h2>Du könntest...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>...Probleme haben, einem Mysterium oder der Erkundung eines versteckten Gebietes zu widerstehen.</li>\n<li>...die Konsequenzen deiner Späße oder Handlungen umfassend überdenken.</li>\n<li>...gern mit deinen Freunden dein erlangtes Wissen teilen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Andere könnten...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>...glauben, du wärst in Denken und Verhalten ein Tier.</li>\n<li>...von deinen Späßen gar nichts halten oder böse darauf reagieren.</li>\n<li>...dich um deine Eleganz und ewige Neugier beneiden.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Körperliche Beschreibung</h2>\n<p>Vanaras sind Humanoide mit affenartigen Merkmalen samt einem langen Greifschwanz und handartiger Füße. Sie werden nur selten größer als 1,50 m, wirken aufgrund ihres schmalen, behänden Körperbaus aber meistens kleiner. Vanaras sind am ganzen Körper mit einer dünnen Schicht weichen Fells bedeckt. Das Fell kann beige, braun oder golden sein und weist nur selten Flecken oder Streifen auf. Auf dem Kopf ist das Haar dichter und länger, sodass die Vanaras es leicht zu komplexen Frisuren arrangieren können - ganz wie sie es lieben. Das Kopfhaar hat fast immer dieselbe Farbe wie das Körperfell, sieht man von den seltenen „Weißmützen“-Vanaras ab; diese haben Mähnen aus dünnem, fahlem Haar und können in jede Vanarafamilie geboren werden. Vanaras haben große, ausdrucksstarke Augen und Münder mit stumpfen Zähnen und spitzen Eckzähnen. Mit 13 Jahren erreichen sie das Erwachsenenalter; die durchschnittliche Lebenserwartung beträgt 60 Jahre.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Vanaras sind ein sehr unterschiedliches Volk. Sie suchen nach Balance und Komfort im Leben. Viele sind sehr gläubig, aber keine Fanatiker. Sie spielen anderen Tricks, ohne dabei bösartig zu sein, sind wagemutig, ohne närrisch zu sein, und neugierig, ohne davon besessen zu sein. Sie wissen zwar um die tiefschürfende Verbindung zwischen ihren Ahnen und Ragdya, spüren aber oft das machtvolle Verlangen, nicht nur dank der Gnade ihres Gottes zu existieren und sich von ihm zu emanzipieren, indem sie ihre eigenen Wege zur Erleuchtung verfolgen. Jene Vanaras, die in Vudra leben, spüren diesen Drang am stärksten, da sie nach Tugend und Wissen streben wollen, um als bessere Wesen wiedergeboren zu werden.</p>\n<p>Auch wenn Ragdya die Vanaras geschaffen hat, fühlen sie sich von ihm auf eine Weise getrennt, die manche schon als unangenehm empfinden. Ragdya ist der ewige Trickster und besitzt unglaubliche Waghalsigkeit, ist aber nicht im Stande, sich zu verändern. Die meisten Vanaras bejubeln sein Treiben und seine närrischen Taten zwar zu Feiertagen, wissen aber auch, dass er auf ewig existieren und nie in eine andere Gestalt reinkarniert wird als jene, die als Vorlage für die Vanaras gedient hat. Vanaras sind allerdings nicht derart unveränderlich. Ein Vanara muss sein eigenes, nicht in Stein gemeißeltes Wesen und die Effekte seines Verhaltens auf seine Seele und seine Suche nach Erleuchtung bedenken. Egal in welchem Umfang Ragdya Unfug treiben und wagemutige Taten ohne Konsequenzen begehen mag, kann dasselbe Verhalten bei einem Vanara sein Streben nach Erleuchtung behindern oder zurückwerfen. Doch das Unfugtreiben und die Spontanität liegen einem Vanara im Blut und sind schwer zu überwinden, sodass viele Vanaras das ganze Leben im Konflikt zwischen diesen Impulsen und der Suche nach Selbstverbesserung verbringen. Zugleich hat dieser innere Streit ein Volk hervorgebracht, welches nach Tugend und Gleichgewicht sucht.</p>\n<p>Vanaras befassen sich mit den Legenden über heldenhafte Angehörige ihres Volkes, um Lehren zu ziehen, wie sie ihre Leben führen sollen. Die größte und am meisten bewunderte Tat dieser legendären Vanaras bestand darin, Ravana, den mächtigsten der Rakschasa-Unsterblichen, auszutricksen - diese Geschichten kennt man sogar in den fernen Aschrams in den schneebedeckten Grenzgebirgen Vudras: Der Tyrann Ravana hatte viele edle Seelen, darunter auch Vanaras und Menschen, zum Bau einer prächtigen Brücke aus azurnen Steinen gezwungen, welche über die Ebenengrenzen hinweg Vudra mit dem Reich des Rakschasas verbinden sollte. Dabei hatte er gefordert, dass jeder Stein so behauen werden sollte, dass er das furchterfüllte, weinende Gesicht eines der Sterblichen zeigte, die ihn bearbeitet hatten. Mit Tricks und Kunstfertigkeit konnten die Vanaras aber die Darstellungen so verändern, dass das Endergebnis subtile Komponenten eines Gebets an das gesamte vudrische Pantheon enthielt. Als die Brücke fertiggestellt war und Ravana mit seiner Scheusalarmee über sie auf die Materielle Ebene marschierte, erzitterten die Steine und wurde dem Gebet so eine weitere Komponente hinzugefügt. Auf diese Weise herbeigelockte Gottheiten brachten die Brücke des unsterblichen Maharadschas zum Einsturz - für diese Erniedrigung gibt er noch immer den Vanaras die Schuld. Viele Vanaras betrachten es daher als ihr Vermächtnis, die Bösartigen und Mächtigen mittels cleverer Tricks und gemeinschaftlicher Bemühungen zu beschämen.</p>\n<h2>Gesinnung und Religion</h2>\n<p>Vanaras lieben es, anderen Streiche zu spielen. Dabei hegen sie aber in der Regel gute Absichten und würden niemals ihrer geliebten Gemeinschaft Schaden zufügen. Sie sind selten Aufwiegler oder Unruhestifter allein um des Säen von Chaos Willen - stattdessen wollen sie die Unflexiblen und Humorlosen zu Bescheidenheit animieren. Die meisten Vanaras achten auf die Tugenden, die zur Verbesserung ihrer unsterblichen Seelen nötig sind, und bemühen sich um ein passendes Verhalten. Die meisten Vanaras sind daher Neutral Gut.</p>\n<p>Der Großteil der Vanaras lebt in Vudra, wo sie es mit einer schwindelerregenden Menge an vudrischen Gottheiten zu tun haben. Gläubige Vanaras verehren in der Regel aber Ragdya an erster Stelle. Die meisten Vanaradörfer werden von Ragdyapriestern geführt. Selbst unreligiöse Vanaras könnten sich in Zeiten der Gefahr an Ragdya um Hilfe bei einer weisen Entscheidungsfindung wenden oder ihn um Anleitung anrufen, wenn ein misslungener Streich ihnen Probleme bereitet, bei dem sie sich nicht sicher sind, wie sie ihm entrinnen sollen. Vanaras, die ihre Selbstkontrolle verbessern wollen, könnten stattdessen Irori verehren, während in Regionen mit lokalen vanarischen Heldengöttern oder Avataren kleine Sekten entstehen könnten. Manche Vanaras verehren den bösen affenartigen Jäger Lahkgya, wenn auch niemals offen, schließlich ist diese Gottheit der wilden, plötzlichen Gewalt in den meisten Vanaragemeinschaften nicht willkommen. Manche Gemeinschaften bringen Lahkgya aber Opfergaben, damit er sie ignoriert.</p>\n<h2>Namen</h2>\n<p>Neugeborene Vanaras erhalten statt Namen nur Beschreibungen ihrer Säuglingspersönlichkeiten oder Angewohnheiten wie z.B. „Grabscher“ oder „Heuler“. Sowie ein Vanara zu sprechen lernt, erhält er einen anderen Namen basierend auf wichtigen oder mythologischen Gestalten oder den Namen eines Ahnen, dem er in Aussehen oder Verhalten ähnelt (oder von dem die Gemeinschaft hofft, dass er dem Ahnen ähneln wird). Der gewählte Name enthält meistens Konsonanten oder Vokale, die der junge Vanara oft nutzt, da Vanara keinen Sinn darin sehen, jemandem einen Namen zu geben, den er nicht problemlos aussprechen kann.</p>\n<h3>Beispielnamen</h3>\n<p>Aschpaka, Chichipi, Haangeno, Hasa, Huanu, Kana, Nammem, Roprutu, Thathona, Unulu, Vivatu</p>\n<h2>Vanarische Herkünfte</h2>\n<p>In Vudra und jenseits des Subkontinents gibt es eine Vielzahl vanarischer Herkünfte.

Andere glauben, die geraubten Abkömmlinge eines vergessenen Ahnen zu sein, dessen Name aus den Aufzeichnungen getilgt wurde. Doch eines ist klar: Vischkanyas sind Meister im Überleben. Im Laufe der Geschichte wurden sie stets wegen ihrer gefährlichen Gaben gefürchtet und deshalb unterdrückt, ausgebeutet und erniedrigt. Doch sie haben es ertragen und durchgehalten. Nun werden sie nicht mehr durch Ketten gebunden und leben in engverbundenen Gruppen.

Sie sind von Natur aus groß und schlank, besitzen gespaltene Zungen und helle goldene Augen mit vertikalen Pupillen. Die Farbe ihrer kleinen, glatten Schuppen rangiert von erdigen Braunund Grüntönen bis zu hellen, farbigen Mustern. Das Haar ist meistens dunkler, auch wenn dies hellere Strähnen nicht ausschließt. Die Frauen sind meistens größer als die Männer, wobei kein Vischkanya wirklich jemals zu wachsen aufhört - alte Vischkanyas können 2,10 m oder größer sein.</p>\n<p>Mischlingsfamilien sind nicht unbekannt. Vischkanyakinder mit einem solchen Familienhintergrund ähneln zuweilen stark dem nichtvischkanyischen Elternteil bis auf ein paar verräterische Einzelheiten wie spitzen Zähnen, die auf ihre Herkunft hinweisen. Vischkanyas bezeichnen diese Kinder manchmal als „Schuppenlose“ oder „Subtile“, heißen sie ansonsten aber wie all ihre anderen Artgenossen willkommen, auch wenn ihr Äußeres leider die Paranoia nähren kann, die Angehörige anderer Abstammungen gegenüber ihrem bereits missverstandenen Volk verspüren.</p>\n<h2>Gesellschaft</h2>\n<p>Vischkanyas leben in kleinen, eng zusammenhaltenden Gemeinschaften aus 50 bis 100 Individuen, welche sich diskret in größere Gesellschaften assimilieren, wobei viele solcher Gruppen sich über ein größeres Areal verteilen. An der Spitze dieser Gruppen steht eine ausgewählte Gruppe von Frauen, die aufgrund ihrer Weisheit und ihres Wissens gewählt wurden. Vischkanyas haben oft mehrere Partner, gebären Mehrlinge und vererben entlang der mütterlichen Linie. Die Kinder können in der Regel ihre Berufswahl frei treffen und wie sie ihren Teil zur größeren Gemeinschaft beitragen können - viele Vischkanyas gehen einem Handwerk oder einem Kunsthandwerk nach. Manche Rollen tragen aber die Bürde, die Geschichte und Kultur ihres Volkes zu bewahren, und diese wichtigen Aufgaben werden über Generationen weitergegeben. Traditionell kommen diese Vischkanyas in geheimen Versammlungen zusammen, um Geschichten, Informationen und Ressourcen zu teilen, die Jugendlichen zu unterstützen und Beratergremien zu bilden, um die Vischkanyas der Region bei weitläufigeren Entscheidungen zu unterstützen. Der Wunsch, die vischkanysche Kultur zu erhalten, trägt diese Praxis seit Jahrhunderten, doch in letzter Zeit wünschen sich manche mehr offene Interaktion mit der Welt, um ihre Kultur stolz mit anderen teilen zu können.</p>\n<p>Andere charakterisieren Vischkanyas oft fälschlich als zu allen giftig und von Natur aus bösartig. Dies führt dazu, dass sie sehr starke Konzepte ihrer eigenen Ethnizität besitzen und was sie von den anderen Abstammungen - den für sie „Fremden“ - unterscheidet. Die meisten Vischkanyas sind freundliche Gastgeber, die auch Nichtvischkanyas gern beherbergen, doch die Idee, solchen Besuchern tiefere Einblicke in die Gemeinschaft oder vielleicht sogar Mitgestaltungsmöglichkeiten zu gestatten, sorgt oft für Proteste und Unruhen. Eltern halten jene ihrer Sprösslinge sorgsam im Auge, die zu viel Zeit mit nichtvischkanyschen Freunden verbringen und Themen wie Romanzen und Hochzeiten mit Angehörigen anderer Abstammungen führen unweigerlich zu langen, ernsthaften Diskussionen und Gesprächen innerhalb der Familie - wenn auch nicht zwangsläufig mit feindseligen Untertönen.</p>\n<h2>Gesinnung und Religion</h2>\n<p>Die hauptsächlich mit dem Erhalt ihrer Gemeinschaften befassten Vischkanyas neigen zu Neutralen Gesinnungskomponenten. Jene, die aufbrechen, um andere über ihre Abstammung zu lehren oder die Welt zu erleben, könnten Neutral oder Chaotisch Gut sein. Ansichten zu Religion können sich von Vischkanyagruppe zu Vischakanyagruppe unterscheiden - manche hängen den alten Traditionen ihres Volkes an, während andere vudrische Gottheiten wie Likha oder Aschukharma verehren. Außerhalb Vudras könnten Vischkanyas sich lokalen Gottheiten mit einem Fokus auf Freiheit oder Künste zuwenden, z.B. Arazni, Cayden Cailean oder Schelyn, oder Gottheiten, deren Zuständigkeitsbereiche den persönlichen Anliegen näher sind.</p>\n<h2>Namen</h2>\n<p>Vischkanysche Namen enthalten in der Mitte oft kurze Vokallaute; dazu kommen viele Konsonanten, die man am besten mit einer gespaltenen Zunge betonen kann. Namen werden oft anhand wichtiger Ereignisse der vischkanyschen Geschichte oder mit Bezug auf die mütterliche Linie gewählt. Nach bedeutsamen Geschehnissen könnte eine Vischkanya für sich einen neuen Namen wählen - und dies wiederholt. Jeder Name repräsentiert einen wichtigen Teil der eigenen Lebensgeschichte - wer man war und wer man nun ist.</p>\n<h3>Beispielnamen</h3>\n<p>Aschath, Casuthis von den Anleitenden Händen, Enysi, Izith, Othasee, Rätsel von Esaviz, Salthazar, Thasi der Zornbrecher</p>\n<h2>Vischkanysche Herkünfte</h2>\n<p>Wähle mit der 1.

When the Age of Ashes created passageways between the Netherworld and Golarion, many wayangs sailed away for a better life.</p>\n<p>These curious wayfarers became Tian Xia's first wayangs, who shared their skills and labor to eke out a solidarity of subsistence with Earthfall's survivors. These explorers also observed how Tian Xia's suffering souls weakened barriers to the Netherworld, whose malignant overlords absorbed the negative emotions to grow in power. While disappointments, melancholia, and other negative experiences were part and parcel of existence, the engineers of the Desecration exploited mortal emotions to oppress both the Universe and its shadow Netherworlds.</p>\n<p>Realizing these planar interconnections, wayang leaders reached a bold conclusion: no world is free until all worlds are. To prevent the Netherworlds' colonial oppressors from harnessing mortal souls and to reclaim the darkness from its present state of malice and anguish, more wayang expeditions arrived in Tian Xia with exorcists and cursebreakers to purify paths to the Netherworld and starve its despots of spiritual power. Toward this end, wayang sages devised the Dissolution, a philosophy of drawing strength and peace from one's inner darkness. They shared their teachings discreetly with those in Tian Xia touched by darkness, instead of leaving such people to be preyed upon by velstracs and other depraved entities.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is at home in the shadows of Tian Xia's oceans and jungles, is heir to mystic and martial arts drawing upon the Netherworld's untainted power, and pursues obscure struggles against dark forces, you should play a wayang.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek out Tian Xia's dark places, such as mountainous caves, shaded mangroves, or rainforest canopies.</li>\n<li>Be curious about this sunlit world, so different from your home's occluded vistas, and seek out new experiences to inspire your artistic expressions and meditative introspection.</li>\n<li>Dream and work toward a time when your people can overthrow your invasive masters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider you creative and seek to commission you as an artisan or appraiser.</li>\n<li>Fail to understand your people's motives and distant struggles.</li>\n<li>Whisper frightful rumors about your origins and attribute curses to your presence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>The rigors of an interplanar struggle and life on or near the seas of Tian Xia grant many wayangs wiry frames, and many carry themselves with a gravitas that belies their small stature. Despite long journeys under cloudless skies, wayangs' skin (ranging from ivory white to duskwood black) doesn't sunburn easily, a blessing attributed to the darkness's love for its children. Thick shadows flit and dance almost like a second layer of skin upon wayang bodies, sheltering them from the sun's glare. Wayangs further decorate their skin with intricate patterns of paint, which non-wayangs often misinterpret as scarification or tattoos. With concentration and training, wayangs can move their shadows independently of their body, an ability that both warriors and storytellers use to great effect, either in aiding their ambushes or illustrating their performances. Wayangs tend to grow their hair long, construct elaborate headdresses of shell and horn to hold their hair up in immaculate hairstyles, and favor long scarves or shawls over their shoulders.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Wayang society encompasses many tensions between communal and individualistic behaviors. While wayangs organize themselves into collectives modeled after agrarian villages or seafaring crews where everyone has to do their part for the shared betterment, hermits and iconoclasts are also afforded special places in wayang society. While individual wayang villages or ships might look to their leaders for direction in everyday matters, these leaders in turn also look to solitary gurus and unconventional visionaries for guidance and inspiration.</p>\n<p>The wayang political universe is composed of multiple overlapping mandalas, concentrations of influence around central charismatic and powerful figures, such as experienced chieftains, ingenious artisans, or intrepid captains. In turn, these individual concentrations cohere around yet other figures famed for righteousness or wisdom, such as sagacious teachers, virtuous princes, or masterful occultists. This approach to social power is useful for organizing diverse diasporas scattered across islands and planes; each collective practices sufficient independence to pursue their own journeys while retaining enough interdependence to respond to others' calls for help and friendship.</p>\n<p>Wayang interactions with other communities usually take place as visiting artisans bearing handcrafted goods of precious materials and exquisite quality. Beyond their aesthetic appeal, these items also provide potent supernatural protection against fiends and undead. Despite the high demand, wayangs don't sell them, but instead offer them freely only to those blessed by shadows, such as particular sorcerer bloodlines. Wayang emissaries use these gifts to aid potential allies and strengthen them against other forces of darkness. In time, many also hope to instruct their newfound friends in the secrets of the Dissolution and call upon their strength to overcome the Desecration.</p>\n<p>Wayang names combine Tian-Sing, Minatan, and Vudrani elements, hints to the vast distances they've traveled. Names also tend toward the allegorically evocative, alluding to the names of places, gods, ancestors, and lineages. Few wayangs named after gods adhere to those deities' teachings, however, a fact that's infuriating to etymologists and theologians. Such supernatural names are instead chosen for their prestige and power, not piety—a practical decision for outsiders seeking protection and power in an unusual land.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Putri Rubah Hebat, Hakim Gunung Api, Raja Ribut Hitam, Adik Musang</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>It's common for a people with such long histories of alliances and respect for community to abide respectfully within society. Wayang society also has positive perceptions toward less pragmatic individuals; many resourceful wayang explorers and artisans embrace attitudes of curiosity and free-spiritedness. Life in darkness teaches the value of skepticism while discouraging moral absolutism or extremism. Wayangs are seldom cruel, perhaps as conscious rejections of the Desecration. Though few champion great causes, many practice quiet benevolence and empathy for those also suffering from oppression or cruelty.</p>\n<p>Wayang religion is largely syncretic, incorporating Iroran austerities of meditation and self-mastery, Sangpotshi and Pharasman metaphysics of planar transmigration, and beliefs in the Netherworld's indigenous spirits and ancestors. Gods are generally seen as tutelary spirits who can help individual supplicants gain supernatural power. In particular, many invoke Lao Shu Po, whom wayangs call Sister Mousedeer. Her cleverness and ability to outmaneuver more powerful divinities and repurpose their power proves especially inspiring to anti-colonial efforts. Ascetics seeking power and wisdom also emulate Ragdya and Diomazul. Notably, despite valuing community and civilization, few worship Abadar due to his place in condemning the Netherworld to Zon-Kuthon's debasement. Ironically, some fallen wayangs have become Kuthite adherents and now strive to capture and torment their former fellows. Popular Edicts act selflessly toward your community, make powerful allies, reject the Desecration of darkness, seek inspiration for your art Popular Anathema cause a creature unnecessary pain, make compromises in the pursuit of freedom, sell your creations without concern, talk openly about the Dissolution</p>\n<h2>Wayang Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Constitution</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Shadowtongue, Wayang, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

        "Yaksha": {
          "name": "Yaksha",
          "text": "<p>Away from shining citadels and opulent palaces, reticent yakshas shelter Tian Xia's rural hinterlands from natural disasters and otherworldly depredations. Famed for resolute vows and prowess with primal magic, yakshas shield the indigent and protect the wilderness, punishing those who threaten either with bone-crushing fury. Yaksha legends recall their origins as divine spirits, overseeing the safety of roads and abodes in a primeval world of vast storm forests and titanic flame floods—the First World, a realm of boundless potentiality. During the Great Abandonment, when the gods left the First World, many yakshas rejected this exodus, instead staying to perform their duties as caretakers. Despite the realm's sudden dearth of divine power, the remaining yakshas swore primordial vows, allowing them to channel power from the nearby Creation's Forge into primal magic and transform swathes of the metamorphic First World into stable regions to provide refuge for destitute fey.</p>\n<p>Yakshas faced great hostility in the First World; their sheltering of impoverished fey didn't garner sympathy but instead drew scorn from others. Affronted fey aristocrats saw yaksha sanctuaries as a challenge to their authority, and the stolid plainness of yaksha domains offended the fey's aesthetic sensitivities. Thus, yaksha communities increasingly became targets and, at some uncertain time, were banished to the Universe. Some of these exiles came to settle in obscurity amid Tian Xia's forests, a fact that planar scholars record as a tragedy. After all, if these yakshas had left alongside the gods earlier, they would surely enjoy greater prominence and privilege on Golarion.</p>\n<p>Yet most yakshas spurn such sentiments, instead expressing quiet pride in fulfilling their vows where even the gods failed. Yakshas view their departure not as a dereliction, but an execution of duty. Their histories claim this egress paved the way for other persecuted fey to escape, and thus their relocation aligned with their obligations. Many yakshas still enjoy amicable relations with fey emigrants, protecting them and their descendants from First World pursuers. Just as many wander bucolic back roads and shadowy swamps, guiding lost travelers, repairing flood-torn bridges, or simply nurturing the green, growing earth—a fundamental pillar of the land. Such stalwart custodianship has earned the reclusive yakshas a reputation for being hospitable, if enigmatic, guardians of the wild.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who's a guardian spirit and has complex relationships with gods and fiends alike, swears primordial vows to uphold noble duties, and acts on behalf of the humble and forgotten, you should play a yaksha.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have sworn vows to safeguard little-known rural communities or remote wildernesses.</li>\n<li>Be stoic yet not unfeeling, accepting others' burdens to make sense of your own identity.</li>\n<li>Inordinately enjoy puns and wordplay, being so familiar with carefully worded vows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Gain amusement from trying to trick you into agreeing to promises to do chores or petty favors.</li>\n<li>Assume you to be tireless and self-sacrificing and expect you to never complain about responsibilities.</li>\n<li>Disdain you as simpleminded and unsophisticated and assume you have little interest in etiquette or fashion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Yakshas aren't born flesh-and-blood into the world. Instead, these guardian spirits occasionally manifest when two conditions are met: a surfeit of positive emotions must exist within an untamed area, and a great need for protection must arise within this land. When both conditions are met, yakshas might appear to answer common folk's prayers and protect the beleaguered land.</p>\n<p>Yakshas often appear as humans with strikingly distinctive physiques; while some stand around 7 feet with powerfully muscled statures, others boast robust portliness and stand no more than 4 feet. All possess luxurious, banyan-like manes of hair that they bind in topknots or under headscarves. The primal power of yaksha vows can sustain them for a thousand years. Ironically, due to perilous nature of their vows, few yakshas live more than a century.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Most yakshas eschew pomp and disregard civilization's excesses. Instead, they gather in provincial sects or assimilate among borderland peoples. While some of the First World's yakshas reigned from kingly temple-cities, Tian Xia's yakshas discourage such grandiosity. Contemporary yakshas attribute love of lucre and prestige as temptations that led some of their number to join the Great Abandonment. Gathering in large numbers also attracted the wrath of the cruel. When the First World's yakshas sheltered weaker fey within their temple-cities, offended fey gentry launched war after war upon them. Thus, most yakshas keep to the margins of society today and do what they can to help the world around them. Where the poor and humble can be found, yakshas might also dwell to serve as protectors or avengers, enshrined in the lowborn's forlorn hopes and desperate wishes.</p>\n<p>Yakshas choose names reflecting their nearby communities' cultural influences. They often pick personal epithets as they swear their primordial vows, representing qualities or natural phenomena they aspire to embody. For example, a pacifistic warrior of the Valashmai Jungle might pick Ahimsaka, a name denoting nonviolence; a Minkaian sorcerer might name themself Osugi after a splendid tree. Names inspired by traditional idioms are also popular; yakshas often truncate such formulaic expressions to create terse, allegorically dense names.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Ahimsaka, Fanren Meng, Hariti, Iryoku, Janavasbha, KyojuYasha, Mahavana, Osugi, Pattana, Tataka, Wu Shizhi</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>As guardian spirits, many yakshas are drawn toward benevolence. Their existence advocates adhering to vows and emphasizes empathy and service, which nurtures compassion. Few, though, are both kind and disciplined; witnessing divine desertion and imperial injustice has caused yakshas to doubt the efficacy and fairness of a hierarchal society, and such skepticism makes it hard for them to feel impartial about such communities. It isn't unheard of for yakshas to act recklessly and without consideration for their vows. Wildhaired, ferocious yakshas have been known to devour entire taboo-violating villages, and Iroran stories mention forest monastics taming such marauding yakshas to lead them upon the path of repentance and enlightenment.</p>\n<p>The popularity of Iroran teachings among otherwise religion-averse yakshas gives these stories credence. Irori's lessons of self-mastery sit easily alongside yaksha discipline, and Irori's mortal origins helps temper yakshas' typical disdain for divinity. Yamatsumi's worship is also not uncommon, though yaksha adherents often couch prayers as respectful requests to a more powerful sibling rather than supplications to a superior. While yakshas stridently oppose Lady Nanbyo's calamitous doctrines, they reserve their greatest antipathy for other god-spurning beings, and they relentlessly battle the cults of rakshasa immortals and asura ranas.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>guide the lost and weary, provide refuge to the weak and downtrodden, swear primordial vows</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>break a vow, gorge yourself on the extravagance of civilization</p>\n<h2>Yaksha Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaws</strong> Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Fey, Yaksha, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Swearing such a vow completes a yaksha's translation from the First World to the Universe. As an individual yaksha binds themself to guardianship, the vow renders permanent physical and spiritual transformations that manifest as yaksha heritages.</p>\n<p>All yaksha heritages come with one or more additional edicts or anathema. Unlike the popular edicts above, you must add the edicts from a heritage to your character. If you repeatedly ignore these precepts, you lose your abilities from your yaksha heritage and any magical abilities from your ancestry. These can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance with an atone ritual.

        "Yaoguai": {
          "name": "Yaoguai",
          "text": "<p>Yaoguai usually begin as simple animals, plants, or objects before finding a way to awaken to sapience, becoming strange shapeshifting creatures in the process. Often originating from an infusion of ambient energy into their original form, yaoguai attain their powers through training their innate magic. Taking care not to expose their true appearance and nature, yaoguai of the same origins or species sometimes form enclaves in which they dedicate their lives to honing their powers or engaging in hedonistic pursuits—though the two aren't mutually exclusive. Yaoguai who lack a solid community, meanwhile, feel compelled to cultivate themselves until they transcend their origin, which might allow them to join society and experience a new kind of freedom.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, extraplanar beings or humanoids are transformed into yaoguai by rituals, arcane mishaps, or sheer coincidence. For some, this occurrence was their heart's desire, though others see their transformation as divine punishment for a misdeed they committed. For those wishing to change back, a long journey of atonement or discovery lies ahead, while those who accept their new forms seek ways to solidify their control over these innate gifts and amass power.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who seeks to change themself fundamentally through power, experience, or transcendence, you should play a yaoguai.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep an ear out for ways to attain, unlock, or train your power such that you can transcend your being.</li>\n<li>Distrust the intentions of others if they're capable of harming you, especially other yaoguai.</li>\n<li>Be insulted when your abilities are questioned.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Show interest or awe at the powers you wield or have at your disposal.</li>\n<li>Are shocked and dismayed to learn that your true shape isn't the form you appear to be.</li>\n<li>Assume you're malicious by nature and envious of society in general.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>A yaoguai's original form can be virtually anything. It's faster to conclude that if something exists, so long as it basks in the perfect conditions for enough time—usually on the scale of thousands of years—it might just become a yaoguai. Yaoguai inherit a wide range of features based on their pre-awakened form; a yaoguai born of animals might have fur or pointed ears; one derived from an object might have stone- or metal-like skin. Due to their wild appearances, many adventuring yaoguai travel by night, which invites suspicion. Thus, shapeshifting into a humanoid form is one of the many arts yaoguai practice meticulously, even if all they can achieve is a form that retains many of their yaoguai features. Some yaoguai prefer such a form. Perhaps they're confident that they have nothing to hide or they like the ease of access to their yaoguai powers in this incomplete form. Others aim to perfect their humanoid form until they become indistinguishable from any other humanoid creature. Many yaoguai are born adults, though their humanoid forms can be of any apparent age. The average life span of yaoguai, in general, is often a reflection of their power. The most powerful yaoguai can easily challenge the life span of dragons, living up to several thousand years, if not becoming agelessly immortal. Rumors abound, therefore, that yaoguai might have ruled much of Tian Xia once upon a time.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Roughly three types of yaoguai exist: those who stick with other yaoguai, those who hop in and out of non-yaoguai societies, and those who live among other societies in disguise. Yaoguai who keep to themselves might be solitary with a small number of associates who live a good distance away. Yaoguai of similar origins might share a domicile and consider themselves part of a found family, with the most senior member acting as the parental or older sibling figure. Some groups have more of a master-student or ruler-retainer dynamic, particularly if the leading yaoguai is significantly more powerful.</p>\n<p>Yaoguai who dip in and out of other cultures are often tricksters who prank the communities they frequent. As bothersome and malicious activity draws attention, most yaoguai groups wisely keep their pranks helpful or tasteful to ensure their longevity. The pranks in such cases might consist of completing tasks or punching up at a local despot. Unfortunately, there are always powerful entities willing to sponsor yaoguai with evil intent, which such yaoguai take as permission to rob and attack settlements without abandon. These infamous stories are the reason why yaoguai bounty hunting is a booming industry in Tian Xia and why yaoguai who live in non-yaoguai communities go to extreme lengths to keep a low profile. Often, these yaoguai live by themselves, in pairs, or in trios at most, as they fear numbers might betray their safety.</p>\n<p>Yaoguai who spontaneously come to be typically pick their own name, which might cheekily refer to their natural form. Other yaoguai gain a name by what others call them, often a nickname that stems from a specific ability, physical trait, or a particular event or action that made them known. These naming schemes can feel like a trap for many yaoguai, however, as it accentuates their yaoguai nature rather than their experience or personality. Being bestowed a name that is unrelated to being yaoguai, or is uniquely theirs, identifies them as an individual and is a considerable honor for many, even more than titles or wealth. For some, restoring a lost or disgraced name is the desired equivalent.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>\"Lamplight\" Deng (lamp), Geomi (spider), Mindeulle (dandelion), Qing Yeliu (green snake), Qiu Haitang (pogonia), Sekiko (stone)</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>There's the misconception that yaoguai are wicked by nature, no matter their intent or actions. This is far from the truth, especially with regard to yaoguai who live among humanoid communities or seek to transcend their being. Most yaoguai can be as heroic as any other of Tian Xia's wandering adventurers. If a yaoguai came from an established yaoguai community, they might lean toward pragmatism, though there are also a few reckless tricksters. Yaoguai who spent much of their formative years by themselves or with a very small group of compatriots are often impulsive unless they follow a cultivation school or philosophy that demands otherwise. Some yaoguai are particularly susceptible to the influence of their environment and peers, meaning they change their opinions more easily and rapidly than other ancestries.</p>\n<p>Various yaoguai enclaves revere Shizuru and Tsukiyo, as it's believed that the power of sunlight and moonlight grants most yaoguai their awakening. Qi Zhong is often cited and worshipped as the guiding teacher of the first yaoguai who ascended to divinity, Sun Wukong. Though Sun Wukong ascended through dubiously ethical methods, nearly all yaoguai know of his tales and exploits, even if the Monkey King isn't a particularly popular subject of worship.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>discover your name, leave a good impression wherever you go, seek ways to cultivate your power and transcend your nature</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>accept the limitations placed upon you, defy the laws of your enclave, dismiss an opportunity for growth</p>\n<h2>Yaoguai Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Charisma, Constitution, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. You can remain in your humanoid form indefinitely, but you revert to your yaoguai form after 1 hour of unconsciousness or 1 minute after death.</p>\n<h2>Yaoguai Heritages</h2>\n<p>Yaoguai literally come in all shapes.

As these circumstances aren't unique to a single ancestry, these heritages—called versatile heritages—are likewise shared by many ancestries.</p>\n<p>The peoples of Golarion are many, and they have a long history of intermingling or dabbling with forces capable of altering the very fabric of a mortal body or soul. The children born to such parents might have traits from each of their parents or physiological manifestations of the forces their ancestors were influenced by, manifesting as a specific heritage.</p>\n<h2>Versatile Heritages</h2>\n<p>Golarion is home to a variety of versatile heritages. Some are born to unusual creatures or arise through specific mundane or supernatural circumstances. Many, however, result from an infusion of extraplanar energy, whether through direct parentage, more distant ancestors, or simply direct exposure to the quintessence of that plane. These individuals are known as planar scions.</p>\n<p>Because the circumstances that give rise to versatile heritages aren't limited to a single ancestry, a versatile heritage can be chosen by a character of nearly any ancestry. Some versatile heritages are more common among some ancestries than others, and some might list additional restrictions specific to that heritage. Your GM may place other restrictions on which ancestries can use a given versatile heritage based on the story and setting. Unlimited Possibilities!</p>\n<p>Though a character can have only one heritage and one lineage feat, the possible permutations of a character's background and family tree are virtually unlimited. An aiuvarin character might still have a changeling parent whose nature is visible in the coloration of their eyes even if they don't have access to changeling ancestry feats, and a pitborn dwarf might very well have an ancestor with fey influences on their bloodline, reflected with a fey muse or patron gained through their class alongside their ancestral fiendishness.</p>\n<h2>Playing A Versatile Heritage</h2>\n<p>To play a character with a versatile heritage, first select your ancestry, just like you would for any character. You gain Hit Points, size, Speed, attribute boosts and attribute flaws, languages, traits, and other abilities from that ancestry. Then, instead of choosing a heritage from those normally available to that ancestry, apply your chosen versatile heritage. You gain all the features from your versatile heritage, some of which might modify or replace statistics, abilities, or traits from your ancestry.</p>\n<p>Since a versatile heritage is a heritage, you can have only one, and you can't have any other heritage in addition to your versatile heritage. Sometimes a versatile heritage might give you an ability that conflicts with an ability from your ancestry.

Whether jumping in to help your crew load the next round, quickly calculating the trajectory of the engine's next shot, or taking the shot yourself, your presence on the team ensures their chances of success are maximized, creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Leading with a Cannon</h4>\n<p>A proper artillerist is more than an engineer, though their skills in that field certainly shouldn't be underestimated. When a war becomes unavoidable, the presence of knights and pikemen might decide a skirmish or battle, but a well-trained artillerist with a reliable squad and a few good siege weapons can make the difference between prolonged months of battle with countless lives lost and a shorter, less bloody affair with fewer deaths and a more lasting victory.</p>\n<p>Castles and fortifications are critical tools for holding land in a world full of empires, kingdoms, and duchies all vying for power. Many wars are won or lost not based on the military might of either side, but on a castle's ability to withstand an extended siege. Without a team of engineers capable of penetrating a castle or keep's defenses, the occupants can wait out an invading force for as long as they have enough food and water to keep their citizens and defenders healthy and fed. Many wars have been \"won\" when the besieged force manages to last through a single winter. Besieging armies whose supply lines break down due to snow-clogged passes or insufficient cold weather gear are forced to retreat due to losses from poor hygiene or hypothermia long before attrition has had an opportunity to impact their opponents.</p>\n<p>An artillerist changes this dynamic, completely rewriting the rules of war. Rather than time being on the side of the besieged, it becomes the tool of the besieger. Each day that passes while a skilled artillerist hammers the castle walls with cannon fire and catapult stones brings the fortifications ever closer to crumbling down. Some wise nobles and warlords who realize their opponents have brought siege weapons, especially powerful black powder siege weapons like cannons, will choose to negotiate surrender before battle is even started, recognizing an inevitable defeat that can be staved off temporarily by sacrificing many soldiers but not thwarted without outside intervention.</p>\n<p>Ruthless or evil artillerists, or the warlords they follow, might take things a step further, specifically targeting granaries to starve enemies out or launching rotting food, corpses, or diseased livestock into parts of the town near water sources. As food and water supplies dwindle, so too does the morale of the castle's inhabitants and defenders. Even a stubborn noble or warlord will find it hard to continue resisting a siege when their own troops mutiny and their citizens begin seeking a way out.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.txWKzKuJus7UBebX]{Artillerist Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in martial weapons</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Artillery is a team sport, where every member of the crew has to rely on the other members. At best, a mistake might just waste time. At worst, a misaligned fuse or a badly set pin could cause the whole thing to explode. You've taken these lessons to heart, and so your presence on an artillery team assists the entire team at every aspect of the siege weapon's deployment and usage. If you're serving on a siege weapon crew, you and all other members gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any checks to Load, Aim, move, or Repair the weapon. When you Aim a siege weapon, you can move the weapon's aim twice as far as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained at least two other feats from the artillerist archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.7WBIXGqZbAKbqEU6]{Named Artillery} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It is a tradition among artillerists to name the siege weapon most important to them and closest to their heart—much as a sailor on a ship, the weapon is their livelihood. You've gone a step further, and you always make sure that your named artillery has the best possible maintenance and upkeep. You can spend a full day adjusting and working on a single siege weapon to designate it as your named artillery. The siege weapon you designated as your named artillery gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, Fortitude saves, and Reflex saves as well as additional Hit Points equal to twice your level.</p>\n<p>During your daily preparations, you must spend at least one hour on maintenance to service your named artillery. If you fail to do so, or if you spend a full day designating a new piece of named artillery, the previous named artillery loses any benefits from this feat. Only one artillerist can designate a particular siege weapon as their named artillery, even if several artillerists are serving on the same siege weapon's crew (though it's typically more efficient for a group with several artillerists to divide them up, assigning one to each siege weapon).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.IeRX0tGbeOF0ev08]{Shorthanded} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<hr />\n<p>Typically, a siege weapon is meant to be run by a crew with a very specific minimum number of members designed to ensure that your crew can account for every possible variable and necessity in loading, aiming, and firing the weapon. In a pinch, however, you can operate it with fewer people, provided you know what you're doing. You can operate a siege weapon with fewer than the minimum number of crew, at an increasing penalty. You and your crew take a -2 penalty to checks to Load, Aim, Launch, move, or Repair the weapon for each person below the minimum crew. The maximum number of missing minimum crew members you can handle with this feat is 5. For example, if a siege weapon had a minimum crew size of 8, you would still need a crew of 3, and you would take a -10 penalty when doing so.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.pph43ZrfvEnQjJXE]{Cannon Corner Shot} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2>\n<hr />\n<p>By loading special ammunition in a particular way, you can make your siege weapons do all manner of tricks that other siege engineers can barely even imagine. If you personally contribute an additional Load action to the siege weapon's loading, above the minimum, you can change a burst into a line twice as long as the size of the burst, or vice versa (so a 10-foot burst turns into a 20-foot line, or a 20-foot line turns into a 10-foot burst).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.moXYfz806x6uXIW9]{Field Artillery} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While castles are generally obliging enough to stay in one place, out in the field positioning is of paramount importance—a gun in the wrong place is worse than useless. You can Interact with an adjacent mounted siege weapon to increase its Speed by 10 feet for one round.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.ivSf8wSIUkK8gwej]{Live Ammunition} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2>\n<hr />\n<p>There are generally few things as ill-advised as being shot out of a cannon or launched by a trebuchet, but people use the tactic every so often in a desperate situation. While it's more humane to use this strategy with mindless constructs or undead, occasionally an exceedingly foolhardy adventurer demands the opportunity to try it. Loading a creature requires two additional Load actions, which you must conduct personally. The creature must be willing, unconscious, or restrained throughout the process, and the siege weapon must be physically capable of firing the creature in question, based on their size and shape. Typically, that means ballistas don't qualify, for example—nor do auto-catapults which require specifically-sized balls—but normal catapults and onagers work just fine. When you Launch the weapon, if the weapon usually targets an area, you target a single 5-foot square instead. The siege weapon deals its normal damage to its target, or to the modified area, and to the creature fired.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.kVSZQvsz1cYjOwxL]{Master Siege Engineer} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 16</span></h2>\n<hr />\n<p>What you don't know about artillery isn't worth knowing and your mastery allows you to perform an impossible number of actions as part of a siege weapon's crew.

          "text": "<p><strong>Rarity</strong> uncommon</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The art of creating the weapons most commonly referred to as \"beast guns\" is truly ancient, with the first iterations of the weapons created on the continent of Arcadia well over 10,000 years ago. This means that beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige associated with star guns has allowed more people access to equivalent destructive power without the intense requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia.</p>\n<p>The art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand new weapon made after they hunt down the creature themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature. Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the prospective beast gunner. However, it's also possible to bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the generations by adding symbolic fresh components from the same kind of creature, after performing the same ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the intent of establishing a bond.</p>\n<p>To perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun. Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight.</p>\n<p>You're one of those who successfully completed the hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think they know how to use beast guns can only imagine.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Choosing Your Beast Gun</h4>\n<p>A beast gunner's bond with their beast gun is deep and mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner, it's important to choose a beast gun that suits your temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if you favor strength and intimidation, a screech shooter is the right choice for you, whereas a spider gun might be optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the battlefield in advance. Similarly, a tentacle cannon is slow and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close range, while a drake rifle is energetic and mobile and can be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun has a personality and magical abilities that attract people who value them.

When you gain your first beastmaster focus spell, you become trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. Your key spellcasting attribute for beastmaster archetype spells is Charisma, and they are primal spells.

When you Command an Animal, either choose one of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else both companions can take 1 action to Stride or Strike.

You and your mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared intent to become a powerful force in combat. You might wield a banner in the name of an order of which you're a member, a liege to whom you've sworn your service, or an ideal you uphold. Or you might fight solely to further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers. Traditionally, cavaliers are envisioned riding atop majestic or fearsome horses, but in reality, all kinds of animals can serve this honorable role, from riding dogs to dinosaurs. What's important is not the type of mount but the connection between the cavalier and their companion. This bond is their true strength.</p>\n<p><strong>CAVALIER PLEDGES</strong></p>\n<p>Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid's animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier's Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an <em>atone</em> ritual.

There are many paths to elementalism, and many classes can become elementalists. As the most basic building blocks of matter, the elements can be shaped to your specific training and understanding. The study of elementalism expands every day.</p>\n<p>You cast spells drawn from multiple traditions and can use the elements to alter and empower your spells, making them manifest and mixing them in unique ways. Most elementalists embrace either the philosophy of four elements common in the Inner Sea or the five-element cycle prevalent in Tian Xia.

When a spirit remnant from such an entity is released as part of your daily preparations, instead of joining the River of Souls, it begins re-forming itself in the time and location noted in its rejuvenation ability. However, you learn a clue about the spirit's unfinished business, which may help you put it to rest permanently.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"info\">EXORCISTS ACROSS GOLARION\n<p>The well-known exorcists of Pharasma use methods of repeated prayer, holy water, and sacred rituals. Ashavic exorcists often dance under the moonlight to entice lost souls and guide them onward. In Osirion, exorcists practice execration, or proactive preventive exorcism techniques. In Northern Garund and some parts of Qadira, playing the stringed tanbura, rattling manjur, and specific drum patterns help cut the threads that tie the spirit to this world. Matanji orcs in the Mwangi Expanse perform exorcisms by drawing tattoo-like diagrams in iron ink. In Tian Xia, exorcists often use fulus (Secrets of Magic 158) to assist in their practice.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.TUIQBw9miDowhezw]{Exorcist Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Occultism or Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned to attract, quell, and purify spirits, housing them in a special receptacle called a spirit dwelling until they're ready to move on. Through the power of prayers or ritual incantations, one mundane object in your possession becomes a spirit dwelling (page 23). Your spirit dwelling functions as a lure for lost spirits weakened by their time on the Material Plane. Each day during your daily preparations, your spirit dwelling attracts a spirit wisp who comes to dwell inside. If your spirit dwelling contains no wisps, you can spend 10 minutes in a minor ritual to cast your spirit dwelling around an area and attract another wisp. You can also capture stronger spirit remnants from vanquished undead spirits, as explained in the sidebar on page 23. As long as your spirit dwelling contains any spirits, it glows faintly, casting dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p>\n<p>As an exorcist, you do more than just collect spirits: you also help rid them of their burdens and lingering resentments, aiding their transition from the Material Plane. Every day, before your daily preparations, any spirit wisps and remnants remaining within your spirit dwelling from the previous day are purified and can join the River of Souls in their final journey to Pharasma's Boneyard.</p>\n<p>You can also learn abilities that let you purify a spirit in your spirit dwelling immediately in a cathartic surge, granting you a helpful effect as they depart for the afterlife.

No two firework technicians use exactly the same fireworks display, even if they come from the same fireworks house and both use the same feat to generate the display. In fact, it's likely that when you use a feat from the firework technician archetype, the resulting display remains a bit different each time as you tinker, perfect, and refine your technique. Even so, you probably have a few themes that you prefer for each of your firework technician feats. For instance, your Coughing Dragon Display might appear in the sinuous serpentine shape of a literal imperial dragon, coughing out glittering trails. It might also resemble a simple series of geometric shapes, an enigmatic spiraling aeon trailing off in a shape with radial symmetry, a pattern shaped like a tree blossoming with flowers in the sky, or anything else you can imagine. To help your fellow players visualize what your character is doing, you might come up with some go-to descriptions or draw art depicting some of your favorite displays.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.MVbNnjqQOK9d8Ki3]{Firework Technician Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned the secrets of making fire and sound bloom using black powder, metals, and paper.

          "text": "<p>Your ties to the living world cling to you in death, your unfinished business reducing you to a spirit. Your soul carries on, but your body is gone. Your mind, too, may have changed: though death can impact thoughts and desires in all sorts of ways, most ghosts experience stronger, more volatile emotions and are frequently overcome by their past ties. A need to reconcile the past overwhelms other needs. Motivations can change over time but are always strong. Pragmatism, compassion, and foresight fall before a ghost's fundamental desires.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.52nzskpmUt9AjUf8]{Ghost Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> You died and returned as a ghost.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have risen as a shell of your former self, a spirit of mist and anguish. You gain the ghost, spirit, and undead traits, and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.SAbzItAI4uwbdnQk]{Basic Undead Benefits}. Your undead craving is to settle your unfinished business. You also gain the incorporeal trait, as described on page 218, except you can't pass through solid objects unless you select the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.7fyWKASX6uNByJF5]{Pass Through} feat. Being a ghost has the following major effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Floating</strong> You can float but are still tethered to the ground. Replace your land Speed with an equal fly Speed. You can't rise more than a few inches above the ground when you Fly. This means you can move above many types of difficult or hazardous terrain without moving slowly or being damaged, even though you can't fly without limit. You can Leap, High Jump, Long Jump, and take similar actions, and use your fly Speed for any calculations that would normally require your land Speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Items</strong> You can transmute physical items to make them part of your incorporeal form. This requires spending 10 minutes with the items within reach, during which you transform the items into part of your form; you can return items you already have incorporated to a corporeal state at the same time. The items retain all their runes and other abilities, need to be invested normally if they have the invested trait, and need to be worn, held, or stowed appropriately. Once you've incorporated the items, you and other incorporeal creatures can use them normally—you can Interact with them, Release them, and so on. Your incorporated weapons gain the benefits of the ghost touch property rune, allowing you to use them normally against both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. Incorporated items become corporeal again only if you transmute them back or are destroyed, in which case, they drop to the ground under you.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks</strong> Your unarmed attacks become magical and deal void damage instead of their normal type.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength</strong> Unlike most incorporeal creatures, your Strength modifier is not -5; you keep the same Strength attribute you had before you became a ghost, though you can only attempt Strength-based skill checks—typically Athletics checks—against other incorporeal creatures, as normal for an incorporeal creature. Against incorporeal creatures, use your Strength normally to determine the results of Athletics checks, Strikes with melee weapons, and any other checks or damage rolls dependent on Strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Ties that Bind</strong> When you become a ghost, work with your GM to choose a bound site and unfinished business, both of which matter for your character's story, as well as some ghost archetype feats. Your bound site tethers you to the physical world and is typically either a location important to you in life or the place where you died. Unfinished business keeps you from passing to the afterlife. If someone resolves your unfinished business, you decide whether to accept the change and pass on, or to fight it. If you pass on, you get a few minutes to say your goodbyes, and then move into the River of Souls and the afterlife. Your character ceases to be. If you fight the change, you remain, though you and the GM might determine a new unfinished business. If you are physically destroyed, you cease your existence as a ghost but still might not be able to pass on to the afterlife if your unfinished business is incomplete. In this liminal state, you might come across strange energies and become another sort of creature, or anchor to a summoner and become an eidolon.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xUaEpnfd1FMGNG1z]{Frightful Moan} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> Once per 10 minutes</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lament your fate, forcing each living creature in a 30-foot emanation to attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune to Frightful Moans for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is frightened 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is frightened 2.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.pwM4RGwCTLiVSic0]{Ghostly Resistance} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your ghostly form becomes innately weaker but also gains resistance to many forms of damage.

Many tap into these powers with no consideration of the morality of their use. For these unscrupulous magic users, it's simply another avenue in their never-ending pursuit of power, and the abilities learned are turned to the caster's personal ends, whatever they may be.</p>\n<p>Others choose a different path. Through spiritual study and introspection, they have come to recognize the evil intrinsic in the existence of undead, the fundamental wrongness of using the universal energy of death to create an appearance of life. To combat this evil, these casters learn to conduct vitality energy and direct it to great effect against the undead they encounter. They may also engage in ongoing study to learn of the nature of life, death, and undeath, and the precise relationship between each state. These scholars and mages are commonly known as hallowed necromancers-a slightly misrepresentative name, as many of them don't use religious methods, but a frequently used shorthand regardless.</p>\n<p>The exact origin of hallowed necromancers' abilities may vary from one to the next. Some are granted their gifts directly by a sympathetic deity such as Sarenrae or Pharasma, while others might use their knowledge of religion and the planes to learn such abilities on their own. Though rarer, it's even possible these practitioners might discover they possess an intuitive understanding and control over abilities that manifest spontaneously as their capabilities grow. Despite this variance, all share a fundamental understanding that undeath is an aberration to be quickly remedied.</p>\n<p>Though the majority of hallowed necromancers have similar goals and are willing to work together, they tend not to form their own organizations. More often, these necromancers attach themselves to existing groups-such as the Knights of Lastwall or Voices of the Spire-and use their powers in support of those groups' causes. Otherwise, they plan and carry out their own personal vendettas against the forces of undeath, often enlisting the help of trusted friends and allies.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">HALLOWED NECROMANCY IN GEB\n<p>As hallowed necromancy lacks any unified credo, its practitioners are found throughout Golarion.

Marshals can come from any class or background, though they all share a willingness to sacrifice their own glory for the greater good of the team. Some marshals lead from the front, sword and shield raised, while others may call instructions and encouragements from the rear while providing allied spellcasters with skilled support. Regardless of their preferred method of combat, marshals' ability to bring the best out in every ally is a valuable addition to any group. Though not every marshal is seen by their allies as a source of encouragement. Such marshals strike fear both in enemies and allies alike to inspire competence in battle and ensure that cowardice will not be tolerated. Such tactics are often seen as more practical than cruel, and the results speak for themselves. Quick action and the necessity to fight drive these leaders and their allies forward into the fray of battle. Regardless of what kind of marshal you wish to become, you will lead your allies to glory and victory.</p>\n<p>While many see marshals as traditionally warriors of martial prowess, anyone could make for a potent marshal. Not every such leader charges into the thick of battle. While doing so may inspire bravery in desperate times, many leaders lead from the safety of the back lines. Spellcaster marshals often lead in this manner. In their mind, the practicality of their own survival outweighs the powerful yet fleeting courage a charge inspires.

A keen and incisive perception is necessary, of course, but that alone won't be sufficient. While many a ranger or rogue must sharpen their senses or face a short career, a true overwatch must be able to apply information received from all five senses (and any additional special senses they might have) to make split-second decisions that work toward achieving a tactical goal. Such a response can partially be trained through hours of daily drills designed to help a potential overwatch separate true threats and situations requiring their skills from false positives, and even situations where they would cause a problem if they didn't hold back. However, while training helps ingrain good practice into one's reflexes and muscle memory, ultimately, an overwatch candidate who lacks an innate degree of good tactical instinct will find such training slow to produce results, or in the worst case, even impossible.</p>\n<p>Beyond senses and instinct, the role of overwatch requires the ability to innovate your enhanced visual gear to assist in removing blind spots and seeing what others miss. This is essential, since you must keep track of your team and nearby foes.

Once a creature has completed the pact by accepting the full burden of a saumen kar and taking the Bound in Ice feat, all transformations are permanent. At that point, they can't retrain the Pactbound Dedication, Frostbite Runes, or Bound in Ice feats and must live out the rest of their lives as something between their old ancestry and a saumen kar.

As a pistol phenom, you understand how to grab everyone's attention with everything you do, especially the way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you use your gun. But what's more, you're well aware of that fact and the power you have over others, and you aren't afraid to flaunt it.</p>\n<p>Despite this attitude, or perhaps because of it, as a pistol phenom you likely tend to get along well with groups of allies, understanding both how to take the spotlight to protect your allies and how to share it to make sure they get their time in the sun. The one exception to this can be other pistol phenoms. When two or more pistol phenoms gather in the same group, it's almost inevitable for a duel or other contest to arise. However, such a contest need not end in enmity. Depending on your temperament, and that of the other pistol phenom, the result of the exhilarating rivalry expressed during competition could be a lifelong friendship, albeit one in which you both keep score of your greatest achievements to compare exploits.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.PFMsj4LtdAIuGn4R]{Pistol Phenom Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in at least one type of one-handed firearm, trained in Deception, trained in Performance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You catch an opponent off-guard by spinning your weapon.

          "text": "<p>Just as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the back rooms of esoteric shops to swap secrets of their trade. In such meetings, a different kind of magic may strike: the spark of innovation! The mixing of magical techniques produces fascinating and unpredictable results. As one of these innovators, sometimes called a spell trickster, you have a knack for pioneering magical techniques and discovering new effects from spells most novice spellcasters take for granted. Whether your unique abilities are the result of weeks of experimentation or a secret passed to you by a traveling practitioner, you delight in surprising others with your tricks.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>The Fruits of Research</h4>\n<p>While magic can spring from many sources, from wizard tutors to self-taught savants, the art of the spell trickster often springs from sophisticated magical research. The magical academies in Golarion have no claim to magic as a whole but can often teach lesser-known variants of a spell to their students. At the Magaambya academy in the Mwangi Expanse, for instance, initiates study multiple traditions of magic, adapting the techniques of harnessing magical essence from one tradition to create new methods of casting spells in another. The Arclords of Nex have spent thousands of years honing spells in both wartime and peace, demonstrating a fine control over the arcane by effortlessly changing their magic to suit their whims. The return of New Thassilon brought thousands of magical dabblers and scholars, each with their own unique tricks and each eager to see what new spell variants have developed in their long absence.</p>\n<p>This isn't to say that spell tricksters come solely from high academia. A sorcerer might demonstrate aberrant powers in her bloodline magic, hinting at a background more complex than a single eldritch influence acting upon her. An oracle might grope at a divine power that they poorly understand and cast a spell in a unique manner simply because they were never taught otherwise. A witch's patron or a whimsical deity might grant a favored servant a special power for whatever strange motives such beings might possess. Magic in Golarion isn't entirely predictable, no matter how many practitioners wish that it was so. While most spellcasters follow predictable patterns in their art, there are always exceptions.</p>\n<p>The rules in this section are presented as part of an archetype, meant for a character dedicated to the art of innovating magic—but you don't have to limit yourself to this premise. At the GM's discretion, a spell trickster feat could be made available to a character as a class feat without the character taking the archetype. In most cases, this option should only be offered as a reward or story element that the character, GM, or group has dedicated a significant amount of time to developing—a character who wishes to partake in these options without GM permission or involvement should simply take the spell trickster archetype. These feats could be used to represent the payoff from extended magical research; finding forgotten or forbidden lore in a lost corner of Golarion; pleasing a god, patron, or other notable power; a magical plane or artifact exerting its influence; or any other number of situations that an adventurer might encounter while exploring. Keep in mind, however, that these feats were created and balanced to be part of an archetype. If allowing spell trickster feats as general class feats begins to negatively impact the game, the players should be willing to walk the decision back and rebuild characters as necessary.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Able to cast spells; trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your experience with magic and its traditions lets you specialize in the casting of certain spells, customizing familiar spells to create novel effects.

They come from a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots, enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers in the world at large. The first to identify themselves as spellshots tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns, the legendary magical firearms that shot white-hot blasts of energy. Wielders of star guns became bound together by the Star Code—a set of cultural expectations that defined how one should behave while using these powerful weapons. You can find more information about star guns, the Crowned Regents, and the Star Code in Guns &amp; Gears.</p>\n<p>Most spellshots continue to come from Arcadia, as the stories describing the relevant skills and training to become one have been passed down over the generations. Many gunslingers who grow up in this region hear of these tales early in their lives, and they develop the techniques to channel magical energy through their firearms in imitation of the Regents' arcane methods. While Arcadia is home to the vast majority of the world's spellshots, the techniques have slowly spread to other regions. However, spellshots remain particularly rare in the Inner Sea region due to the unique history of guns there and their connection to the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which exists in a magic-dead region of the Mana Wastes.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4th:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.DBsqWivnSaEo8jz5]{Basic Arcana}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.SHUfHzElHZPXJFiP]{Basic Wizard Spellcasting}</p>\n<p><strong>6th:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Tg3Iyq55xW9PTSW9]{Advanced Arcana}</p>\n<p><strong>8th:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.DwU6CmK4KsH8A3hu]{Arcane Breadth}</p>\n<p><strong>12th:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.hpCBELEKGA4ynYv4]{Expert Wizard Spellcasting}</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.BwDIwjHasZwcd61Z]{Spellshot Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.OmgtSDV1FubDUqWR]{Way of the Spellshot}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You cast arcane spells like a wizard, gaining a spellbook with four common arcane cantrips of your choice.

You know how to maintain your dynamo and how to customize it to suit your needs and style, incorporating any promising new technologies you encounter into its design.</p>\n<p>There's a significant distinction, however, between someone who merely has a sterling dynamo prosthesis and someone like you who is a true sterling dynamo. With their recent invention, people in Absalom and Dongun Hold with access to the technology have begun to adopt sterling dynamos as their prostheses of choice, among the wide variety of amazing options already available in both markets. However, not everyone who chooses to use sterling dynamo technology is a member of the sterling dynamo archetype.</p>\n<p>With the sterling dynamo archetype, you both use a sterling dynamo prosthesis and truly understand its advantages, limitations, and limitless potential. You don't have to literally be your own mechanic, as there's no requirement for a sterling dynamo to be particularly skilled at crafting, but even if you aren't, you can still \"feel\" what's right when it comes to adjusting and optimizing your dynamo. Whether you implement these improvements yourself or present your mechanic with ideas and insights that allow them to achieve something special on your behalf, your strength and ingenuity are what make you a sterling dynamo.</p>\n<p>As you train to use your dynamo in all sorts of adventures, you may become capable of feats its original inventors never dreamed possible. In fact, as you progress in the archetype and explore the possibilities, you might find that these inventors want to interview you in order to apply your insights and help them create a new generation of the technology with even greater capabilities. The sterling dynamo's adaptability grants it vast potential, so the sky's the limit!</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Prosthetics in Golarion</h4>\n<p>Prosthetics in Golarion don't require membership in an archetype or special organization to obtain. A character can purchase a simple prosthetic foot, eye, hand, or virtually any other body part for as little as 5 silver pieces, with more expensive prosthetics that are decorated with unique customizations or designs available for a corresponding mark-up. For more information on prosthetics, see page 69 of Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar. The sterling dynamo prosthetic technology presented here was created through collaboration between a Dongun Hold prosthesis inventor, who created the flexible silvery clockwork joint system, and a researcher from the Clockwork Cathedral in Absalom, who created a prototype variant that increased how customizable the model was and sent it back to the dwarven inventor to iterate further. That iteration became the sterling dynamo that entered the market in late 4721 AR. It has been widely applauded for its adaptability in both combat and everyday use.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fdSbB0EQVxFgLoEd]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<hr />\n<p>You obtain a sterling dynamo prosthetic, which allows you to replace or augment a limb, or even add a simple new non-prehensile limb, such as a tail. While your sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never increases your character's number of hands or prehensile limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities or effects.</p>\n<p>Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which makes it more effective against certain types of creatures, such as devils and werewolves).</p>\n<p>You have several options to customize your sterling dynamo. First, choose whether you have a power driver dynamo, which deals @Damage[1d6[bludgeoning]] damage and has the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which deals @Damage[1d4[bludgeoning]] damage and has the agile and finesse traits. Most dynamos are automated, so they don't require a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks. However, you can instead choose to make your dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled dynamo, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the dynamo when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p>\n<p>You need to keep your sterling dynamo wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous, so in most situations, it won't be an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding up your dynamo, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to Disable the dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the dynamo's remaining operational time. When your dynamo is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any other abilities from this archetype until you wind the dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the sterling dynamo archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.sVEF7j9Wh1KNGPUm]{Modular Dynamo} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fdSbB0EQVxFgLoEd]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your dynamo has modular configurations, allowing you to swap between various different possibilities with ease in order to adapt to various situations in combat.

But magic is so much more than that—it's thought, will, and action, and with the right talismans, you can make even the cut of a sword a deeply magical act. This all hinges on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear. You know how to make and use the perfect talisman for any job. The utility of talismans seems endless. They can help swords to swing harder, shields to block better, grant a burst of speed in a desperate situation, and even save one from a lethal fall. This all excites you, but no more than exploring just how far you can push your talent. What are the true limits of these baubles? You've heard rumors and tales of great dabblers like yourself mastering the art of creating and affixing fantastical magical memorabilia. Some say that these great sages have found a way to affix multiple talismans to a single object, circumventing the most fundamental limitation of the art. Whether you were formally trained or picked up the skill as a hobby, your talent is undeniable, and the usefulness of talismans is apparent.

Each day during your daily preparations, you can make two talismans with an item level no higher than half your level. You must know each talisman's formula.

Any saving throw DC required by a temporary talisman you create uses the highest of your class DC, spell DC, or the talisman's DC.</p>\n<p>Finally, when you Affix a Talisman, you can (in any combination) affix or remove up to four talismans in the 10-minute span.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Talisman Dabbler archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.RlhvppSmQRqL2RUe]{Quick Fix} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Talisman Dabbler Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can attach a talisman using only a bit of glue and some string.

Funny how that works out, isn't it?</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Skilled or Lucky</h4>\n<p>Part of the fun of roleplaying an unexpected sharpshooter is the ambiguity and mystery of how your character achieves their surprising success. Your character at first seems like they bumble into their successes through sheer circumstance. However, when the circumstances pile up, others might start to suspect another possibility: perhaps your character is secretly so incredible that they not only achieve impressive results but do so in a way that hides their skill behind a veneer of lucky breaks. Ultimately, either could be true about your character, or some combination of both. You might decide the truth together with the GM as soon as you take this archetype or hold off until later to make that call. Because this archetype hints at hidden talent intentionally obfuscated, it offers a good choice for a character who's secretly more powerful or skilled than they seem or who must hide their abilities for some reason-perhaps associated with the plot of the campaign.</p>\n<p>If your inclination is to play a character who hides their abilities, consider training in the Deception skill and taking skill feats like Charming Liar and Confabulator that emphasize your character's crafty nature and skill at concealing their true intent.</p>\n<p>If you instead prefer to play a character who's legitimately a bit uncoordinated but abnormally lucky, you might choose to pursue actions that have a high chance of earning you a Hero Point.

This means that only the first target suffers any special effects tied to the bullet (if it was magical ammunition, for example), but each target you hit still takes the same damage dealt by your Strike. Normally, all damage is of the same damage type as the initial bullet. However, the GM might choose to change the damage type based on their description of the chain reaction.

It doesn't matter if it's as common as a chariot or as complex as an airship, there's always some aspect of the vehicle you can improve upon. Pilots, drivers, and sailors alike value your expertise, and many seek you out to work on their vehicles. While you can make a great profit working on custom vehicles for wealthy clients, you still keep a vehicle of your own to tinker with as your personal passion project.</p>\n<p>You might be part of a vehicle mechanic union, working with other mechanics and engineers to find fair jobs and support each other's labor. While some vehicle mechanic unions are secular, many realize the benefits of organizing alongside a sympathetic religion, and so they typically adopt the ideals of economically-focused gods like Abadar or deities interested in crafting such as the goddess Brigh—the Whisper in Bronze—the goddess of invention. Whether religious or secular, vehicle mechanic unions take the bonds between fellow union members seriously. While this might mean your character becomes obligated to help a fellow union member who needs your help, it also means you have steadfast allies you can fall back on in your own time of need. In dire straits, such a connection can be worth its weight in gold.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Unions</h4>\n<p>Vehicle mechanics typically ply their trade to those who need to keep their vehicles finely tuned. As in most other such trades, some vehicle mechanics form unions to keep business practices fair and to protect each other from predatory employers. The Absalom Shipwright's Union is the largest union for vehicle mechanics in Absalom, with over a thousand builders, carpenters, and engineers among its membership. Almenia Oarstone (LG female dwarf shipwright) is the current leader of the union, having been a member for more than 60 years. It is said that you can count on one hand the number of ships that have docked in Absalom on which she has never worked. The Shipwright's Union manages shipbuilding and repairs in both the Devil's Own and the Sea King Shipyard, and sometimes dispatches members to handle jobs that need doing at the Docks.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Using Vehicles</h4>\n<p>The vehicle mechanic plays best in a campaign where the PCs adventure together in one shared vehicle that the mechanic can enhance, such as in a pirate campaign on a single vessel. In this way, the vehicle mechanic archetype pairs excellently with a PC who has chosen the trick driver archetype. Vehicles are an element you should consider carefully before deciding to include, even in a guns and gears campaign. Vehicles are relatively complicated and can move very fast, which may make mapping encounters quite difficult. They can also move characters too far from the fight for other participants to respond. Think carefully before deciding whether to include the vehicle mechanic archetype, and make sure that vehicle use is right for your campaign's style and encounter area size.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fL5lO5Odp7iJPkan]{Vehicle Mechanic Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Intelligence +2, trained in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are adept at designing and maintaining mechanical vehicles, and you lavish your attention and ingenuity on one vehicle in particular.

Whatever your purpose—fighting crime, inciting rebellion, sowing chaos—your vigilante identity makes you both hard to pin down and a mysterious, intriguing subject of gossip. While many adventurers prefer to bask in the glory or infamy of their actions, you keep that part of your life a secret. There are various reasons why you might do this. Perhaps you have something or someone in your life that you want to protect from the dangers and threats that your other life.

It could also be that you don't like attention and wish to retain the ability to step away from it all and relax in peace. Regardless of your reasons, you have a secret identity and will go to great lengths to keep it secret. Vigilantes can have many goals and agendas. Some see them as glory seekers, but more often than not, they are working towards some lofty goal. Perhaps they are trying to inspire a people to fight back against their oppressors.

The process usually takes weeks, beginning with forced starvation, followed by the consumption of spices and tonics that desiccate the subject's internal organs.</p>\n<p>Very rarely, mummies are created by natural processes occurring in locations that are cursed or inundated by void energy.

Unlike other Ilverani, also called \"snowcaster elves\" by outsiders, you find outsiders interesting and believe there is much to learn from having conversations and relationships with others. Whether to watch them, teach them, or to keep would-be enemies close, you believe a broad smile, ageless learning, and a watchful eye are key. Some see this watchful and outwardly friendly nature as condescending, but they don't understand the reason why worshipers of Findeladlara feel a duty to uphold this tradition. When Earthfall struck and most of the other elves on Golarion fled to Sovyrian or delved deep into the earth, the elves that would one day come to be known as Ilverani remained and sought to shelter others from catastrophe. They built refuges to protect others and helped guide people to safety during the Age of Darkness. While Twilight Seekers today don't build safe structures, they do work to build bonds among people so that society can be protected against other catastrophic events should they come to pass.</p>\n<p>This calling brings you in contact with many different cultures, yet you seek to preserve the ways of your people.

For many years, the traditions of the harrower were limited to regions like Varisia and Ustalav, where the Varisian people had more deeply established traditions.

With Dyzad's guidance, Domorans summoned more such spirit guides, all of which the citizens worshipped as gods long after his passing.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Alchemy</h2>\n<p>You understand the reactions between all manner of reagents and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.rmwa3OyhTZ2i2AHl]{Craft} activity, or you can use specially prepared chemicals that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost.

You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.is3Oz9wt11lNq62K]{Alchemical Crafting} feat, and you can automatically identify alchemical items that you have the formula for</p>\n<h3><strong>Formula Book</strong></h3>\n<p>An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.qCEOZ6109Yo34tRx]{Formula Book} for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to any formulas you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to select the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.XR95taODq1sq82Du]{Inventor} skill feat so you can invent them.</p>\n<p>As normal, having the base formula is sufficient when Crafting upgraded types of the item—you don't need to learn higher-level formulas. For instance, if you have the 1st-level formula for a minor @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.hDLbR56Id2OtU318]{Elixir of Life}, you can create a minor, lesser, moderate, greater, major, or true elixir of life as long as you meet the level and other prerequisites. Items with type entries that have widely varied functions require separate formulas, but most alchemical items have a structure similar to elixir of life.</p>\n<h3><strong>Advanced Alchemy</strong></h3>\n<p>During your daily preparations, you spend some time to create alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, you can use an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.4ftXXUCBHcf4b0MH]{Alchemist's Toolkit} instead of an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.k6xZkDUpF7E1Totd]{Alchemist's Lab}, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements. You can Craft a number of alchemical items up to 4 + your Intelligence modifier. Each item must be in your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than your level, and have the consumable trait. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.</p>\n<h3><strong>Versatile Vials</strong></h3>\n<p>You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing special reagents. During your daily preparations, you can create a number of versatile vials up to 2 + your Intelligence modifier, which is also your maximum number of vials. If you're below your maximum number, you can gather reagents from the environment around you. For every 10 minutes you spend in exploration mode, you regain 2 vials; this doesn't prevent you from participating in other exploration activities.</p>\n<p>Versatile vials are infused items, and are destroyed if not used by the next time you make your daily preparations. A vial you create is always the highest type you could Craft. See the sidebar for statistics on using a versatile vial as a bomb. You can also use vials for Quick Alchemy (see below) and your research field can add to the ways you can use a vial.</p>\n<p>You can store all your versatile vials within your alchemist's toolkit, with no increase to its Bulk. Though versatile vials are physical objects, they can't be duplicated or preserved in any way.</p>\n<p>The versatile vials can be thrown like bombs, with the following statistics.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>VERSATILE VIAL</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<section class=\"traits\">\n<p>ACID</p>\n<p>ALCHEMICAL</p>\n<p>BOMB</p>\n<p>CONSUMABLE</p>\n<p>INFUSED</p>\n<p>SPLASH</p>\n</section>\n<p><strong>Usage </strong>held 1 hand; <strong>Bulk</strong> —</p>\n<p><strong>Activate </strong><span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> Strike</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This tiny glass flask contains volatile chemicals that can be used offensively in a pinch.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Type</strong> lesser; <strong>Level</strong> 1</p>\n<p>The bomb deals 1d6 acid damage and 1 acid splash damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Type</strong> moderate; <strong>Level</strong> 4</p>\n<p>You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls.

Stufe verleiht, erhältst du die Vorteile deiner gewählten Abstammung und deines Hintergrundes.</p>\n<h2>Anfangskompetenzgrade</h2>\n<p>Mit der 1. Stufe erlangst du eine Reihe von Kompetenzgraden, die deine Grundausbildung repräsentieren. Du findest sie am Beginn dieser Klassenbeschreibung.</p>\n<h2>Bardenzauberei</h2>\n<p>Deine Magie entspringt deinem esoterischen Wissen. Du kannst mittels der Aktivität Zauber wirken okkulte Zauber nutzen.</p>\n<p>Als Barde kannst du bei Anrufungen meistens ein Instrument spielen oder Limericks aufsagen. Ebenso kannst du die Gestik in Tanz und dramatische Pantomime integrieren.</p>\n<p>Du kannst am Tag bis zu zwei Zauber des 1. Grades wirken. Du musst einen Zauber kennen, um ihn wirken zu können. Die Anzahl an Zaubern, die du jeden Tag wirken kannst, wird als deine Zauberplätze bezeichnet; du lernst deine Zauber über das Klassenmerkmal Zauberrepertoire. Wenn deine Bardenstufe steigt, steigt auch die Anzahl deiner Zauber am Tag, ebenso kannst du schließlich Zauber höheren Grades wirken.</p>\n<p>Manche deiner Zauber verlangen von dir einen Zauberangriffswurf, um festzustellen, wie effektiv sie sind. Bei anderen müssen deine Gegner gegen deinen Zauber-SG würfeln - in der Regel im Rahmen von Rettungswürfen. Da Charisma dein Schlüsselattribut ist, nutzen deine Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG deinen Charismamodifikator.</p>\n<h3><strong>Erhöhte Zauber</strong></h3>\n<p>Sobald du Zauberplätze des 2. oder höheren Grades erlangst, kannst du diese Zauberplätze mit stärkeren Versionen niedriggradigerer Zauber belegen. Du erhöhst den Grad des fraglichen Zaubers auf den Grad des genutzten Zauberplatzes. Du musst einen Zauber des gewünschten Grades in deinem Zauberrepertoire haben, um ihn auf den fraglichen Grad erhöhen zu können. Viele Zauber weisen spezifische Verbesserungen auf, wenn sie auf bestimmte Grade erhöht werden. Das Klassenmerkmal Signaturzauber lässt dich bestimmte Zauber frei im Grad erhöhen.</p>\n<h3><strong>Zaubertricks</strong></h3>\n<p>Einige deiner Zauber fallen in die Kategorie Zaubertrick. Ein Zaubertrick verwendet keinen Zauberplatz. Du kannst einen Zaubertrick beliebig oft am Tag wirken. Dabei wird sein Grad automatisch auf die Hälfte deiner Stufe (aufgerundet) erhöht, was dem höchsten Zaubergrad entspricht, den du als Barde wirken kannst. Als Barde der 1. Stufe wirkst du Zaubertricks auf dem 1. Grad und als Barde der 5. Stufe als Zauber des 3. Grades.</p>\n<h2>Zauberrepertoire</h2>\n<p>Die Sammlung der Zauber, welche du wirken kannst, wird als dein Zauberrepertoire bezeichnet. Auf der 1. Stufe lernst du zwei okkulte Zauber des 1. Grades deiner Wahl und fünf okkulte Zaubertricks deiner Wahl. Wähle diese von den gewöhnlichen Zaubern der Liste der okkulten Zauber oder aus anderen Quellen okkulter Zauber, zu denen du Zugang hast. Du kannst jeden Zauber in deinem Zauberrepertoire wirken, indem du einen Zauberplatz eines passenden Zaubergrades verwendest.</p>\n<p>Wenn du weitere Stufen erlangst, fügst du neue Zauber deinem Zauberrepertoire hinzu. Wann immer du einen Zauberplatz erlangst (Tabelle Bardenzauber am Tag), fügst du deinem Zauberrepertoire einen Zauber desselben Grades hinzu. Mit der 2. Stufe wählst du einen weiteren Zauber des 1. Grades; mit der 3. Stufe wählst du zwei Zauber des 2. Grades usw. Wenn du Zauber hinzufügst, kannst du eine höhergradige Version eines dir bereits verfügbaren Zaubers hinzufügen, so dass du ihn nun mit erhöhtem Grad wirken kannst.</p>\n<p>Auch wenn du Zauberplätze und die Zauber in deinem Zauberrepertoire zur selben Zeit erlangst, werden beide separat gehalten. Sollte ein Talent oder andere Fähigkeit einen Zauber deinem Zauberrepertoire hinzufügen, so erhältst du deshalb keinen zusätzlichen Zauberplatz und umgekehrt.</p>\n<h3><strong>Zauber im Repertoire austauschen</strong></h3>\n<p>Wenn du neue Zauber für dein Repertoire erhältst, möchtest du möglicherweise einige deiner alten Zauber auswechseln. Wenn du eine Stufe erlangst und neue Zauber erlernst, kannst du einen deiner alten Zauber gegen einen anderen Zauber desselben Grades auswechseln. Dabei kann es sich auch um einen Zaubertrick handeln. Du kannst ebenfalls im Rahmen des Umlernens während der Auszeit Zauber auswechseln.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Stufe</th>\n<th>Zaubertricks</th>\n<th>1.</th>\n<th>2.</th>\n<th>3.</th>\n<th>4.</th>\n<th>5.</th>\n<th>6.</th>\n<th>7.</th>\n<th>8.</th>\n<th>9.</th>\n<th>10.</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* Das Klassenmerkmal Magnum Opus verleiht dir Zauberplätze des 10.

Kompositionen sind eine besondere Art von Zauber, welche oft zum Wirken die Fertigkeit Darbietung benötigen. Kompositionszauber sind eine Unterart des Fokuszaubers. Um einen Fokuszauber zu wirken, musst du 1 Fokuspunkt aufwenden, und dein Fokusvorrat fasst zu Beginn 1 Fokuspunkt. Du füllst deinen Fokusvorrat während deiner täglichen Vorbereitungen auf, außerdem kannst du die Aktivität Fokus erneuern nutzen, um 1 Fokuspunkt nach 10 Minuten zurückzuerlangen, in denen du auftrittst, eine neue Komposition schreibst oder anderweitig deine Muse nährst.</p>\n<p>Fokuszauber werden wie Zaubertricks automatisch im Grad auf deine halbe Stufe (aufgerundet) erhöht. Sie erfordern keine Zauberplätze und können auch nicht mittels Zauberplätzen gewirkt werden. Manche Talente können dir weitere Fokuszauber verschaffen und/oder deinen Fokusvorrat erhöhen, allerdings fasst dein Fokusvorrat maximal 3 Fokuspunkte.</p>\n<p>Du lernst den Kompositionszauber @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.WILXkjU5Yq3yw10r]{Rettende Darbietung}, der dich vor hör- und sichtbaren Effekten schützt.</p>\n<h3><strong>Kompositionszaubertricks</strong></h3>\n<p>Kompositionszaubertricks sind spezielle Kompositionszauber, die keine Fokuspunkte kosten, so dass du sie beliebig oft nutzen kannst. Kompositionszaubertricks erlangst du zusätzlich zu den Zaubertricks, welche du aus der Liste der okkulten Zauber wählst, allerdings können dir in der Regel nur Talente weitere Kompositionszaubertricks verschaffen. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Zaubertricks kannst du über Bardentalente erlangte Kompositionszaubertricks aber nicht mit späteren Stufen austauschen (die einzige Ausnahme hiervon wäre ein Austausch des fraglichen Talents mittels Umlernen). Du erlernst den Kompositionszaubertrick @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.IAjvwqgiDr3qGYxY]{Hymne des Mutes}, welcher die Angriffe, den Schaden und die Verteidigung deiner Verbündeten gegen Furcht stärkt.</p>\n<h2>Musen</h2>\n<p>Als Barde wählst du mit der 1. Stufe eine Muse. Deine Muse leitet dich an, Großes zu erreichen. Sie könnte eine körperliche Kreatur sein, eine Gottheit, eine Philosophie oder ein fesselndes Mysterium. Abhängig von der Art der Inspiration, welche du erlangst, verleiht dir deine Muse der 1. Stufe ein spezifisches Bardentalent der 1. Stufe und fügt deinem Zauberrepertoire einen Zauber hinzu.</p>\n<p>Aus folgende Musen kannst du wählen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.4ripp6EfdVpS0d60]{Enigma}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.YMBsi4bndRAk5CX4]{Maestro}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.N03BtRvjX9TeHRa4]{Krieger}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.y0jGimYdMGDJWrEq]{Universalgenie}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bardentalente<span style=\"float:right\">2.</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitstalente<span style=\"float:right\">2.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 2. Stufe und jeder weiteren geraden Stufe erlangst du ein Fertigkeitstalent. Sie gehören der Kategorie Fertigkeit an. Um ein Fertigkeitstalent wählen zu können, musst du wenigstens den Kompetenzgrad Geübt in der assoziierten Fertigkeit besitzen.</p>\n<h2>Allgemeine Talente<span style=\"float:right\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen erlangst du ein Allgemeines Talent.</p>\n<h2>Ausgeprägte Reflexe<span style=\"float:right\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Deine Reflexe helfen dir, Gefahren auszuweichen. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Reflexwürfe steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitsverbesserungen<span style=\"float:right\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und jeder weiteren ungeraden Stufe erhältst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung. Du kannst eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung entweder nutzen, um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu erlangen oder um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu Experte zu verbessern.</p>\n<p>Mit der 7. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Experte zu Meister zu verbessern. Und mit der 15. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Meister zu Legende zu verbessern.</p>\n<h2>Signaturzauber<span style=\"float:right\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Dank deiner Erfahrung kannst du manche Zauber flexibler wirken. Wähle für jeden Zaubergrad, zu dem du Zugang besitzt, einen Zauber dieses Grades als Signaturzauber. Du kannst den Grad deiner Signaturzauber frei erhöhen und musst keine erhöhten Versionen des fraglichen Zaubers extra erlernen. Solltest du einen Signaturzauber auf einem höheren Grad als seinem Minimumgrad erlernt haben, kannst du die schwächeren Versionen ebenfalls wirken, ohne sie separat erlernt zu haben. Solltest du einen Signaturzauber austauschen, kannst du einen Ersatzsignaturzauber desselben Zaubergrades wählen, zu dem du den vorherigen Zauber erlernt hattest. Du kannst ebenso spezifisch umlernen, um einen Signaturzauber gegen einen anderen Zauber desselben Grades auszutauschen, ohne andere Zauber auszuwechseln; dies erfordert dieselbe Zeit wie das Umlernen eines normalen Zaubers.</p>\n<h2>Abstammungstalente<span style=\"float:right\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Neben dem Abstammungstalent, mit dem du das Spiel beginnst, erhältst du mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen ein Abstammungstalent.</p>\n<h2>Attributsverbesserungen<span style=\"float:right\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Neben der Verbesserung, die dir deine Klasse mit der 1. Stufe verleiht, erhältst du vier freie Attributsverbesserungen, die du anderen Attributsmodifikatoren zuweist.</p>\n<p>Mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle jeweils weiteren 5 Stufen erhältst du vier freie Attributsverbesserungen für jeweils unterschiedliche Attributsmodifikatoren. Sollte ein Attributsmodifikator bereits +4 oder höher sein, so sind zwei Verbesserungen nötig, um ihn um 1 zu verbessern; da du immer nur eine Verbesserung einem Modifikator zuweisen kannst, erhältst du in diesem Fall mit der ersten Verbesserung noch keine Erhöhung des Modifikators, sondern erst mit der zweiten Verbesserung mehrere Stufen später.</p>\n<h2>Zauberexperte<span style=\"float:right\">7.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Ausgeprägte Zähigkeit<span style=\"float:right\">9.</span></h2>\n<p>Du bist körperlich sehr abgehärtet. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zähigkeitswürfe steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Herz des Künstlers<span style=\"float:right\">9.</span></h2>\n<p>Die größten Darbietungen erfordern ein Verständnis des eigenen Denkens und fehlerfreie Konzentration. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Willenswürfe steigt auf Meister. Wenn du bei einem Willenswurf einen Erfolg erzielst, zählt dieser als Kritischer Erfolg.</p>\n<h2>Bardenwaffenexpertise<span style=\"float:right\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Du bist mit deinen Waffen sehr vertraut. Dein Kompetenzgrad im Umgang mit allen Einfachen Waffen, allen Kriegswaffen plus für Waffenlose Angriffe steigt auf Experte. Wenn du mit einem Angriffswurf einen Kritischen Erfolg erzielst, während eine deiner Kompositionen aktiv ist, erhältst du Zugang zu den Kritischen Spezialisierungseffekten deiner Waffe oder deines Waffenlosen Angriffes.</p>\n<h2>Meisterhafte Wahrnehmung<span style=\"float:right\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Im Rahmen deiner Abenteuer hast du deine Sinne geschärft und gelernt, auf kleinste Details zu achten. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Wahrnehmung steigt auf Meister.</p>\n<h2>Leichte Rüstungsexpertise<span style=\"float:right\">13.</span></h2>\n<p>Du kannst Angriffen besser ausweichen, während du eine Leichte Rüstung oder keine Rüstung trägst. Dein Kompetenzgrad im Umgang mit Leichten Rüstungen und in Ungerüsteter Verteidigung steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Waffenspezialisierung<span style=\"float:right\">13.</span></h2>\n<p>Du weißt mittlerweile, wie du mit den dir am besten bekannten Waffen größere Verletzungen zufügen kannst. Du verursachst 2 Punkte zusätzlichen Schaden mit jenen Waffen und Waffenlosen Angriffen, bei denen du den Kompetenzgrad Experte besitzt. Mit dem Kompetenzgrad Meister steigt dieser Zusatzschaden auf 3 und mit dem Kompetenzgrad Legende auf 4.</p>\n<h2>Zaubermeister<span style=\"float:right\">15.</span></h2>\n<p>Du hast das Okkulte gemeistert. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG steigt auf Meister.</p>\n<h2>Starkes Herz des Künstlers<span style=\"float:right\">17.</span></h2>\n<p>Deine Darbietungen beeinflussen den Verstand und lassen die Gefühle fließen. Dein Wissen, wie du dies erreichst, verleiht dir zudem ein unvergleichliches Verständnis deines eigenen Verstandes. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Willenswürfe steigt auf Legende. Wenn du bei einem Willenswurf einen Erfolg erzielst, zählt dieser als Kritischer Erfolg. Solltest du bei einem Willenswurf einen Kritischen Fehlschlag landen, zählt dieser als normaler Fehlschlag. Scheitert dir ein Willenswurf gegen einen schadenerzeugenden Effekt, erleidest du nur halben Schaden.</p>\n<h2>Magnum Opus<span style=\"float:right\">19.</span></h2>\n<p>Du erlangst Zugang zu den höchsten Graden der Zauberei. Füge zwei gewöhnliche okkulte Zauber des 10. Grades deinem Repertoire hinzu. Du erlangst einen Zauberplatz des 10. Grades, mit dem du diese Zauber nach den üblichen Regeln für Barden wirken kannst. Du kannst Zauberplätze des 10. Grades nicht in Verbindung mit Fähigkeiten nutzen, welche dir weitere Zauberplätze geben würden oder die es dir gestatten, Zauber zu wirken, ohne dabei Zauberplätze zu verbrauchen. Du erlangst im Rahmen deiner Progression keine weiteren Zauber des 10. Grades. Du kannst durch das Talent @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xhuXpOFOxDpJgngm]{Perfekte Zugabe} einen zweiten Zauberplatz des 10. Grades erlangen.</p>\n<h2>Zauberlegende<span style=\"float:right\">19.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein okkultes Zauberkönnen ist legendär. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG steigt auf Legende.</p>"

The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on pages 35–39 of Player Core, along with their edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one deity.</p>\n<h3><strong>Skill</strong></h3>\n<p>You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.</p>\n<h3><strong>Anathema</strong></h3>\n<p>Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.</p>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone} ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity.</p>\n<h3><strong>Sanctification</strong></h3>\n<p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.</p>\n<p>If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists \"none,\" you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you <em>atone</em>.</p>\n<p>Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy sanctification and causes are uncommon options.</p>\n<p><strong>Holy</strong>: You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them\" and the anathema \"Commit murder.\" Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline, the acts listed there are anathema to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Holy</strong>: You gain the unholy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not put another's needs before your own or those of your deity\" and the anathema \"Commit an entirely altruistic act, such as giving something away in charity\" and \"Put anyone's needs before those of your deity.\" None of these prevents you from performing acts others might consider helpful, but these acts must be done with the expectation that they ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity.</p>\n<h3><strong>Deific Weapon</strong></h3>\n<p>You zealously bear your deity's favored weapon. If it's an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). If the weapon is uncommon, you gain access to it, and if it's an advanced weapon, you treat it as a martial weapon for the purposes of proficiency.</p>\n<h3><strong>Champion's Aura</strong></h3>\n<p>You're surrounded by an aura in a 15-foot emanation. It has the aura and divine traits. Any follower of your deity within the aura immediately knows you're a champion of your deity. This aura is used as the range for your champion's reaction and for various other effects. You can suppress or resume the aura as a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and it ends if you fall unconscious.</p>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>You devote yourself to a specific cause in your deity's name. Some are limited to sanctification, as noted in parentheses. Your cause adds to your edicts and anathema and grants you a special reaction called your champion's reaction, which appears after the divider, along with its upgrades if you gain the relentless reaction and exalted reaction class features at higher levels.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.8YIA0jh64Ecz0TG6]{Desecration} (Unholy):</strong> You selfishly corrupt and destroy.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.h1NGH4TVeBljftni]{Grandeur} (Holy):</strong> You exemplify the glory and splendor of the celestial realms.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.EQ6DVIQHAUXUhY6Y]{Iniquity} (Unholy):</strong> You destroy, take advantage, and act with dishonor.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.peEXunfbSD8WcMFk]{Justice}:</strong> You follow laws and mete out just punishment.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.FCoMFUsth4xB4veC]{Liberation}:</strong> You oppose tyranny and fight for freedom.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.HiIvez0TqESbleB5]{Obedience}:</strong> You enforce hierarchies and order.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.UyuwFp0jQqYL2AdF]{Redemption} (Holy):</strong> You try to redeem those who commit wicked deeds.</p>\n<h2>Devotion Spells</h2>\n<p>Your deity's power grants you special divine spells called devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. Choose either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.ZL97DcoJ8us6EwAF]{Shields of the Spirit} or a spell based on your deity's divine font (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.zNN9212H2FGfM7VS]{Lay on Hands} if your deity allows <em>heal</em>, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.jFmWSIpJGGebim6y]{Touch of the Void} if your deity allows <em>harm</em>).</p>\n<p>It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first devotion spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.</p>\n<p>Your devotion spells are divine spells. Your spellcasting attribute is Charisma.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points.</p>\n<h2>Champion Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a champion class feat.</p>\n<h2>Shield Block</h2>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block} general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Blessing of the Devoted<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your deity blesses your service with a boon. This might come in the form of a spirit that visits you and inhabits your items or body, a mysterious divine tattoo upon your body, or the like. Choose one of the following blessings, or any other to which you have access.</p>\n<p><strong>Blessed Armament</strong>: Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows. You gain that armament's critical specialization effect, and you grant the armament a property rune of your choice from the following list: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.P6v2AtJw7AUwaDzf]{Fearsome}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.JQdwHECogcTzdd8R]{Ghost Touch}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.qlunQzfnzPQpMG6U]{Returning}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.roeYtwlIe65BPMJ1]{Shifting}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.LwQb7ryTC8FlOXgX]{Vitalizing}. During your daily preparations, you can change the spirit to inhabit a different armament, grant a different rune, or both.</p>\n<p><strong>Blessed Shield:</strong> In your hands, a shield gains the minor @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.x9SNVpAAnXKJeoqp]{Reinforcing} rune. As you go up in level, the shield gains the reinforcing rune of your level (lesser at 7th level, moderate at 10th level, greater at 13th level, major at 16th level, and supreme at 19th level). If your shield already has the appropriate reinforcing rune for your level, or if it's a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.f9ygr5Cjrmop8LWV]{Sturdy Shield} of the same level as the appropriate reinforcing rune, the shield's Hardness instead increases by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Blessed Swiftness:</strong> You gain a +5-foot status bonus to Speed.

You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Champion Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Prayers strengthen your divine power. Your proficiency ranks for your champion class DC, spell attack modifier, and spell DC increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Reflex Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've developed a knack for dodging danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Relentless Reaction<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your champion's reaction improves, typically to punish the attacker with spiritual backlash. It gains the relentless reaction benefit listed in your cause below your champion's reaction.</p>\n<h2>Sacred Body<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>The power of your deity keeps your body safe from harm, as true an edifice of the faith as a great temple. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Divine Will<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your faith grants mastery of your will. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Exalted Reaction<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your champion's reaction exalts nearby allies, allowing them to benefit as well.

Stufe verleiht, erhältst du die Vorteile deiner gewählten Abstammung und deines Hintergrundes.</p>\n<h2>Anfangskompetenzgrade</h2>\n<p>Mit der 1. Stufe erlangst du eine Reihe von Kompetenzgraden, die deine Grundausbildung repräsentieren.</p>\n<h2>Gottheit</h2>\n<p>Als Kleriker zählst du zu den sterblichen Dienern einer Gottheit, die du vor allen anderen verehrst. Die Hauptgottheiten des Pathfinder-Hintergrundes findest du im Gottheiten Kompendium zusammen mit ihren Geboten, Zuständigkeitsbereichen und den Vorteilen, die sie ihren Klerikern verleihen. Deine Gottheit verleiht dir den Kompetenzgrad Geübt in einer Fertigkeit und im Umgang mit ihrer Bevorzugten Waffe. Sollte die Bevorzugte Waffe eine Waffe der Seltenheitskategorie Ungewöhnlich sein, so erlangst du Zugang zu dieser Waffe. </p>\n<p>Deine Gottheit fügt zudem deiner Zauberliste Zauber hinzu. Du kannst diese Zauber wie andere Zauber der Liste der göttlichen Zauber vorbereiten, sobald du Zauber des fraglichen Grades als Kleriker vorbereiten kannst. Manche dieser Zauber sind normalerweise nicht Teil der Liste der göttlichen Zauber, doch wenn du sie auf diese Weise vorbereitest, werden sie zu göttlichen Zauber.</p>\n<p>Das Kompendium der Gottheiten bietet dir übrigens auch eine Übersicht aller Gottheiten.</p>\n<h3><strong>Anathema</strong></h3>\n<p>Taten, welche grundlegend im Gegensatz zu den Idealen deiner Gottheit stehen, sind ein Anathema deiner Religion. Wenn du Zauber erlernst oder wirkst, welche für deine Gottheit ein Anathema darstellen, oder Taten begehst oder Gegenstände nutzt, die ebenfalls als Anathema zählen, verlierst du die Gunst deiner Gottheit.</p>\n<p>Das Wirken von Zaubern der Kategorie Unheilig ist nahezu immer ein Anathema für Gottheiten, die keine unheilige Weihe erlauben, ganz wie das Wirken von Zaubern der Kategorie Heilig ein Anathema für Gottheiten darstellen, die keine heilige Weihe gestatten. Ebenso könnte das Wirken von Zaubern, welche ein Anathema zu den Geboten oder Zielen deiner Religion darstellen, deine Verbindung zu deiner Gottheit stören. So wäre z.B. das Wirken eines Zaubers zum Erschaffen von Untoten ein Anathema für Pharasma, die Göttin des Todes. Viele Taten, die als Anathema gelten würden, sind nicht in den formellen Aufzählungen in den Abschnitten der Gottheiten aufgeführt. In Grenzfällen bestimmen du und dein SL, welche Handlungen ein Anathema sind.</p>\n<p>Solltest du genug Taten vollbringen, die ein Anathema für deine Gottheit sind, verlierst du die magischen Fähigkeiten, welche in Verbindung mit deiner Gottheit stehen. Der SL bestimmt die betroffenen Klassenmerkmale, zu ihnen zählen höchstwahrscheinlich Göttlicher Quell und alle göttlichen Zauberfähigkeiten. Diese Fähigkeiten können nur zurückerlangt werden, wenn du deine Reue im Rahmen des Rituals @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Buße} demonstrierst.</p>\n<h2>Klerikerzauberei</h2>\n<p>Deine Gottheit verleiht dir die Macht zum Wirken göttlicher Zauber. Du bist ein Zauberkundiger und kannst mittels der Aktivität Zauber wirken göttliche Zauber nutzen. Als Kleriker rufst du in der Regel mehr oder weniger laut deine Gottheit und/oder ihre mächtigen Diener namentlich oder mit dem Titel an, während du heilige Symbole deines Glaubens oder andere Dartstellungen deiner Gottheit in die Luft zeichnest.</p>\n<p>Auf der 1. Stufe kannst du jeden Morgen zwei Zauber des 1. Grades und fünf Zaubertricks vorbereiten. Dabei muss es sich um gewöhnliche Zauber von der Liste der göttlichen Zauber oder um andere göttliche Zauber handeln, zu denen du Zugang hast. Vorbereitete Zauber stehen dir so lange zur Verfügung, bis du sie wirkst oder bis du deine Zauber erneut vorbereitest. Die Anzahl an Zaubern, die du jeden Tag wirken kannst, wird als deine Zauberplätze bezeichnet.</p>\n<p>Wenn deine Klerikerstufe steigt, steigt auch die Zahl deiner Zauber am Tag, ebenso kannst du schließlich Zauber höheren Grades wirken - siehe auch die Tabelle Klerikerzauber am Tag.</p>\n<p>Manche deiner Zauber verlangen von dir einen Zauberangriffswurf, um festzustellen, wie effektiv sie sind. Bei anderen müssen deine Gegner gegen deinen Zauber-SG würfeln - in der Regel im Rahmen von Rettungswürfen. Da Weisheit dein Schlüsselattribut ist, nutzen deine Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG deinen Weisheitsmodifikator.</p>\n<h3><strong>Zaubergraderhöhungen</strong></h3>\n<p>Sobald du Zauberplätze des 2. oder höheren Grades erlangst, kannst du diese Zauberplätze mit stärkeren Versionen niedriggradigerer Zauber belegen. Du erhöhst den Grad des fraglichen Zaubers auf den Grad des genutzten Zauberplatzes. Viele Zauber weisen spezifische Verbesserungen auf, wenn sie auf bestimmte Grade erhöht werden.</p>\n<h3><strong>Zaubertricks</strong></h3>\n<p>Einige deiner Zauber fallen in die Kategorie Zaubertrick. Ein Zaubertrick verwendet keinen Zauberplatz. Du kannst einen Zaubertrick beliebig oft am Tag wirken. Dabei wird sein Grad automatisch auf die Hälfte deiner Stufe (aufgerundet) erhöht, was in der Regel dem höchsten Zaubergrad entspricht, den du als Kleriker wirken kannst. Als Kleriker der 1. Stufe wirkst du Zaubertricks auf dem 1. Grad und als Kleriker der 5. Stufe als Zauber auf dem 3.

Solltest du genug Taten vollbringen, die gegen die Interessen der Natur gehen, verlierst du die magischen Fähigkeiten der Druidenklasse, darunter Naturzauberei und die Vorteile deines Ordens.

Du wirst zwar immer deinem Ausgangsorden angehören, allerdings ist es nicht ungewöhnlich, dass Druiden erbitten, bei anderen Orden studieren zu können, um ihren Horizont und ihr Verständnis der Natur zu erweitern - und SC-Druiden zählen zu jenen, die am ehesten die Kräfte verschiedener Orden vermischen.</p>\n<p>Ordenszauber sind eine Unterart des Fokuszaubers. Um einen Fokuszauber zu wirken, musst du 1 Fokuspunkt aufwenden, und dein Fokusvorrat fasst zu Beginn 1 Fokuspunkt. Du füllst deinen Fokusvorrat während deiner täglichen Vorbereitungen auf, außerdem kannst du die Aktivität Fokus erneuern nutzen, um 1 Fokuspunkt nach 10 Minuten zurückzuerlangen, in denen du mit den Geistern der Natur kommunizierst oder dich auf andere Weise passend zu deinem Orden um die Wildnis kümmerst.</p>\n<p>Fokuszauber werden wie Zaubertricks automatisch im Grad auf deine halbe Stufe (aufgerundet) erhöht. Sie erfordern keine Zauberplätze und können auch nicht mittels Zauberplätzen gewirkt werden. Manche Talente können dir weitere Fokuszauber verschaffen und/oder deinen Fokusvorrat erhöhen, allerdings fasst dein Fokusvorrat maximal 3 Fokuspunkte.</p>\n<p>Die Orden kannst du hier finden:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.u4nlOzPj2WHkIj9l]{Orden der Blätter}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.NdeFvIXdHwKYLiUj]{Orden der Flamme}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.fKTewWlYgFuhl4KA]{Orden der Steine}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.acqqlYmti8D9QJi0]{Orden der Stürme}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.POBvoXifa9HaejAg]{Orden der Tiere}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.v0EjtiwdeMj8ykI0]{Orden der Ungebändigten}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.FuUXyv2yBs7zRgqT]{Orden der Wellen}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Druidenzauberei</h2>\n<p>Die Kraft der Wildnis fließt durch deine Adern. Du kannst mittels der Aktivität Zauber wirken Naturzauber nutzen. Als Druide könnten deine Anrufungen beim Zaubern Bitten an deine Umgebung oder das Rezitieren uralter Schwüre sein; deine Hände könnten die Bewegungen von Weidenästen im Wind nachahmen oder sich zu Klauen verkrampfen, während du mit Gesten deine Magie lenkst.</p>\n<p>Auf der 1. Stufe kannst du jeden Morgen zwei Zauber des 1. Grades und fünf Zaubertricks vorbereiten. Dabei muss es sich um Gewöhnliche Zauber von der Liste der Naturzauber oder um andere Naturzauber handeln, zu denen du Zugang hast oder mittels Zauber erlernen Zugang erlangst. Vorbereitete Zauber bleiben dir verfügbar, bis du sie wirkst oder bis du deine Zauber erneut vorbereitest. Die Anzahl an Zaubern, die du jeden Tag wirken kannst, wird als deine Zauberplätze bezeichnet.</p>\n<p>Wenn deine Druidenstufe steigt, steigt auch die Zahl deiner Zauber am Tag, ebenso kannst du schließlich Zauber höherer Grade wirken - siehe auch die Tabelle Druidenzauber am Tag.</p>\n<p>Manche deiner Zauber verlangen von dir einen Zauberangriffswurf, um festzustellen, wie effektiv sie sind. Bei anderen müssen deine Gegner gegen deinen Zauber-SG würfeln - in der Regel im Rahmen von Rettungswürfen. Da Weisheit dein Schlüsselattribut ist, nutzen deine Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG deinen Weisheitsmodifikator.</p>\n<h3><strong>Erhöhte Zauber</strong></h3>\n<p>Sobald du Zauberplätze des 2. oder höheren Grades erlangst, kannst du diese Zauberplätze mit stärkeren Versionen niedriggradigerer Zauber belegen. Du erhöhst den Grad des fraglichen Zaubers auf den Grad des genutzten Zauberplatzes. Viele Zauber weisen spezifische Verbesserungen auf, wenn sie auf bestimmte Grade erhöht werden.</p>\n<h3><strong>Zaubertricks</strong></h3>\n<p>Einige deiner Zauber fallen in die Kategorie Zaubertrick. Ein Zaubertrick verwendet keinen Zauberplatz. Du kannst einen Zaubertrick beliebig oft am Tag wirken. Dabei wird sein Grad automatisch auf die Hälfte deiner Stufe (aufgerundet) erhöht, was dem höchsten Zaubergrad entspricht, den du als Druide wirken kannst. Als Druide der 1. Stufe wirkst du Zaubertricks auf dem 1. Grad und als Druide der 5. Stufe als Zauber des 3.

Dein Ziel ist es nicht, etwas so Banales zu erreichen wie einfach nur einen Kampf zu gewinnen; du willst wertvolle Daten sammeln, die du zur Verbesserung deiner Erfindungen nutzen kannst!</p>\n<h2>Während gesellschaftlichen Begegnungen...</h2>\n<p>... stellst du nützliche Zusammenhänge her, wenn du eine Vielzahl von akademischen Themen erörterst, insbesondere wenn du über Themen sprichst, die mit Handwerk und Erfindung zusammenhängen. Du suchst oft nach Möglichkeiten, Mäzene zu umwerben, um einige deiner teuren oder unorthodoxen Experimente zu finanzieren. Schließlich zahlen sich die Materialien, die du für deine Erfindungen brauchst, nicht von selbst!</p>\n<h2>Während der Erkundung...</h2>\n<p>... studierst du eifrig das Design und die Konstruktion der Umgebungen, die du erkundest und notierst dir für später clevere Fallen, geniale Mechanismen oder besondere Architektur, auf die du stößt.</p>\n<h2>Während der Auszeit...</h2>\n<p>... entwickelst du neue Entwürfe und verwirklichst sie durch sorgfältige Ausarbeitung und akribische Liebe zum Detail. Vielleicht änderst du auch frühere Erfindungen, um Daten einzupflegen, die du vor Ort gesammelt hast.

Stufe verleiht, erhältst du die Vorteile deiner gewählten Abstammung und deines Hintergrunds.</p>\n<h2>Anfangskompetenzgrade</h2>\n<p>Mit der 1. Stufe erlangst du eine Reihe von Kompetenzgraden, die deine Grundausbildung repräsentieren. Du findest sie am Beginn dieser Klassenbeschreibung.</p>\n<h2>Schnellgang</h2>\n<p>Du besitzt eine Schar kleinerer, von dir selbst erfundener Geräte, von Muskelstimulatoren bis hin zu Schüttelkolben. Wenn es nötig ist, kannst du sie in Schnellgang setzen, um dich im Kampf zu unterstützen.</p>\n<h2>Innovation</h2>\n<p>Du machst zwar ständig neue Erfindungen machst, doch es gibt eine, die deine herausragendste Arbeit darstellt, die, von der du hoffst, dass sie - mit entsprechender Verfeinerung - die Welt verändern könnte. Wählen eine der untenstehenden Innovationen. Die Stufe deiner Innovation ist gleich deiner Stufe. Wenn deine Innovation zerstört wird, kannst du 1 Tag Auszeit aufwenden und einen Fertigkeitswurf auf Handwerkskunst ablegen gegen einen hohen SG für deine Stufe; bei einem Erfolg baust du sie wieder zusammen. Eine Innovation funktioniert nur durch deine ständige Wartung und Bastelei und hat daher keinen Marktpreis.</p>\n<p>Die Innovationen, aus denen du in diesem Band wählen kannst, sind wie folgt.</p>\n<h3>Konstrukt</h3>\n<p>Deine Innovation ist ein Maschinenwesen, z. B. ein mechanisches Konstrukt, das aus Zahnrädern und Getrieben besteht. Es handelt sich dabei um einen Prototyp-Konstruktgefährten (S. 32) und du kannst die meisten seiner Basiswerte verbessern, indem du auf höheren Stufen Talente wählst, wie z. B. Verbesserter Konstruktgefährte. Wenn du die Aktion Schnellgang nutzt, erhält das Konstrukt die gleichen Vorteile des Schnellgangs wie du und erleidet bei einem Kritischen Fehlschlag die gleiche Menge Feuerschaden.</p>\n<p>Du weißt, wie du zusätzliche Zeit dafür aufwenden kannst, deine Konstruktinnovation für einen komplexeren Aktionsplan zu steuern, zu kontrollieren oder zu programmieren. Du kannst 2 Aktionen statt nur 1 Aktion aufwenden, um deinen Konstruktgefährten anzuweisen. Dein Konstruktgefährte kann dann eine zusätzliche Aktion verwenden (im Normalfall 3 Aktionen statt 2).</p>\n<p>Wähle eine anfängliche Konstruktmodifikation, die du auf deine Konstruktinnovation anwendest, entweder aus den folgenden oder aus anderen anfänglichen Konstruktmodifikationen, zu denen du Zugang hast. Diese Modifikationen verändern die Fähigkeiten oder die Gestalt des Konstrukts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Amphibische Konstruktion:</strong> Erhöhter Auftrieb, ein Ruder und ein Antriebsmittel wie ein vergrößertes Heck oder ein leistungsstarker Propeller befähigen dein Konstrukt, sich im Wasser fortzubewegen. Deine Innovation erhält eine Bewegungsrate für Schwimm von 7,50 m.</li>\n<li><strong>Erhöhte Geschwindigkeit:</strong> Maschinell betriebene Beine, effiziente Getriebe in den Rädern oder Kettenwalzen oder zusätzliche Verstärker machen dein Konstrukt schneller. Die Bewegungsrate deiner Innovation erhöht sich auf 12 m.</li>\n<li><strong>Erhöhte Größe:</strong> Du hast deine Konstruktinnovation größer als die meisten gebaut. Dein Konstrukt ist Groß. Wenn du diese Modifikation gewählt hast und deine Konstruktinnovation ein Verbesserter Konstruktgefährte wird oder auf andere Weise die Fähigkeit erhält, Groß zu werden, kannst du sofort zu einer anderen anfänglichen Konstruktmodifikation wechseln.</li>\n<li><strong>Erstaunliches Gerät:</strong> Du ordnest der groben Intelligenz deines Konstrukts spezialisierte Fertigkeiten zu. Deine Innovation erhält den Kompetenzgrad Geübt in Einschüchterung, Heimlichkeit und Überlebenskunde.</li>\n<li><strong>Fingerfertigkeit:</strong> Deine Konstruktionsinnovation hat gelenkige Hände oder ähnliche Anhängsel mit beträchtlicher Fingerfertigkeit. Sie kann mit bis zu zwei ihrer Gliedmaßen Handhaben-Aktionen ausführen. Wie bei Gefährten üblich, kann es dennoch keine Waffen führen oder Gegenstände halten, die nicht die Kategorie Gefährte haben. Darüber hinaus kann es auch keine Gegenstände aktivieren.</li>\n<li><strong>Projektilwerfer:</strong> Dein Konstrukt hat einen montierten Pfeilwerfer, eine eingebaute Kanone oder eine ähnliche Bewaffnung. Deine Innovation erhält einen waffenlosen Fernkampfangriff, der 1W4 Punkte Stich- oder Wuchtschaden verursacht (du suchst ihn dir aus, wenn du diese Modifikation wählst). Der Angriff hat die Waffeneigenschaft Geschoss und eine Entfernungseinheit von 10 m.</li>\n<li><strong>Sensormatrix:</strong> Zusätzliche sensorische Geräte geben deiner Innovation Dämmersicht und Dunkelsicht sowie ungenauen Erschütterungssinn mit einer Reichweite von 10 m.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Rüstung</h3>\n<p>Deine Innovation ist eine hochmoderne mittelschwere Rüstung mit einer Vielzahl von angebrachten Knöpfen und Geräten. Wähle einen der Spielwertesätze aus Tabelle 2-2: Spielwerte Rüstungsinnovation für deine Rüstungsinnovation (oder wähle einen anderen Satz Spielwerte für Rüstungsinnovationen, auf die du Zugriff hast).</p>\n<p>Deine Rüstungsinnovation kann wie eine gewöhnliche Rüstung mit Fundamental- und Eigenschaftsrunen versehen werden. Aufgrund der einzigartigen Eigenschaften deiner Innovation ist jedoch jeder außer dir im Umgang mit ihr Ungeübt, selbst wenn er normalerweise im Umgang mit mittelschwerer Rüstung Geübt (oder besser) wäre.</p>\n<p>Wähle eine anfängliche Rüstungsmodifikation, die du auf deine Innovation anwendest, entweder aus den folgenden oder aus anderen anfänglichen Rüstungsmodifikationen, zu denen du Zugang hast.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Außerweltlicher Schutz:</strong> Nur weil du die Wissenschaft benutzt, heißt das nicht, dass du deine Rüstung nicht mit sorgfältig ausgewählten Materialien und Geräten zum Schutz vor außerweltlichen Angriffen verbessern kannst. Du erhältst Resistenz in Höhe von 3 + der Hälfte deiner Stufe gegen Leerenschaden bzw. gegen Lebensschaden, wenn du über Leerenheilung verfügst (z. B. weil du ein Dhampir bist). Du erhältst Resistenz in gleicher Höhe gegen alle Arten von Gesinnungsschaden (gut, böse, chaotisch, rechtschaffen), der dir schaden können (beachte, dass Kreaturen eine bestimmte Art von Gesinnungsschaden nur dann erleiden, wenn sie eine entgegengesetzte Gesinnung haben; zum Beispiel kannst du nur dann bösen Schaden erleiden, wenn du eine gute Gesinnung hast).</li>\n<li><strong>Exoskelett (nur Kraftrüstung):</strong> Deine Rüstung unterstützt deine Muskeln mit einem sorgfältig gefertigten Exoskelett. Wenn du deine Rüstung in den Schnellgang schaltest, unterstützt das Exoskelett auch deine athletischen Fähigkeiten. Unter dem Effekt von Schnellgang erhältst du einen Situationsbonus von +1 auf Fertigkeitswürfe für Athletik. Wenn du Meister in Handwerkskunst bist, erhöht sich dieser Situationsbonus auf +2.</li>\n<li><strong>Geräuschdämpfung (nur Trickrüstung):</strong> Du hast deine Rüstung so gestaltet, dass du nicht auffällst und Geräusche etwas gedämpft werden. Wenn du deine Rüstung in den Schnellgang schaltest, verstärken die Dämpfer ihre Wirkung, und deine Tarnung verbessert sich. Wenn du unter dem Effekt von Schnellgang stehst, erhältst du einen Situationsbonus von +1 auf Fertigkeitswürfe für Heimlichkeit. Wenn du Meister in Handwerkskunst bist, erhöht sich dieser Situationsbonus auf +2.</li>\n<li><strong>Geschwindigkeitsverstärker:</strong> Du hast Verstärker in deiner Rüstung, die deine Geschwindigkeit erhöhen. Du erhältst einen Zustandsbonus von +5 Fuß/1,50 m auf deine Bewegungsrate. Wenn du unter dem Effekt von Schnellgang stehst, erhöht sich der Zustandsbonus auf +10 Fuß/3 m.</li>\n<li><strong>Harmonischer Oszillator:</strong> Du hast deine Rüstung so entworfen, dass sie unhörbar auf genau der richtigen Frequenz pulsiert, um Interferenzen gegen Kraft- und Schallwellen zu erzeugen. Du erhältst Resistenz von 3 + der Hälfte deiner Stufe gegen Kraft- und Schallschaden. Wenn du unter dem Effekt von Schnellgang stehst, erhöht sich die Resistenz um 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Metallische Reaktanz:</strong> Die Metalle in deiner Rüstung sind sorgfältig legiert, um Elektrizität zu erden und dich vor säurehaltigen chemischen Reaktionen zu schützen. Du erhältst Resistenz in Höhe von 3 + der Hälfte deiner Stufe gegen Säure- und Elektrizitätsschaden. Wenn du unter dem Effekt von Schnellgang stehst, erhöht sich die Resistenz um 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Phlogistonregulator:</strong> Eine Isolierschicht innerhalb deiner Rüstung schützt dich vor schnellen Temperaturwechseln. Du erhältst Resistenz in Höhe der Hälfte deiner Stufe gegen Kälte- und Feuerschaden. Wenn du unter dem Effekt von Schnellgang stehst, erhöht sich die Resistenz um 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Mittelschwere Rüstung</th>\n<th>RK Bonus</th>\n<th>GE-Limit</th>\n<th>Rüstungsmalus</th>\n<th>Rüstungsbewegungsmalus</th>\n<th>Stärke</th>\n<th>Last</th>\n<th>Gruppe</th>\n<th>Rüstungseigenschaften</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Kraftrüstung</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n<td>-5 Fuß/1,50 m</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Mehrschichtig</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trickrüstung</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Mehrschichtig</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Waffe</h3>\n<p>Deine Innovation ist eine unmöglich aussehende Waffe, die durch zahlreiche ungewöhnliche Mechanismen ergänzt wird. Sie beginnt mit den gleichen Werten wie eine gewöhnliche einfache Waffe oder Kriegswaffe der Stufe 0 oder einer anderen einfachen Waffe oder Kriegswaffe der Stufe 0, zu der du Zugang hast. Du kannst stattdessen auch die Werte einer gewöhnlich einfachen Waffe oder Kriegswaffe der Stufe 1 oder einer anderen einfachen Waffe oder Kriegswaffe der Stufe 1 verwenden, zu der du Zugang hast, aber du musst den Preis für die Waffe bezahlen. Einer Waffeninnovation können auf die gleiche Weise wie einer gewöhnlichen Waffe Fundamental- und Eigenschaftsrunen hinzugefügt werden. Wegen der einzigartigen Eigenschaften deiner Innovation ist jeder mit Ausnahme von dir im Umgang mit ihr Ungeübt, selbst wenn er normalerweise Geübt (oder besser) mit im Umgang mit einfachen Waffe oder Kriegswaffen ist. Wenn du die Aktion Schnellgang nutzt, kannst du den zusätzlichen Schaden durch Schnellgang zu Feuerschaden ändern.</p>\n<p>Wähle eine anfängliche Waffenmodifikation, die du auf deine Innovation anwendest, entweder aus den folgenden oder aus anderen anfängliche Waffenmodifikationen, zu denen du Zugang hast. Diese Modifikationen gewähren zusätzliche Waffeneigenschaften, manchmal mit zusätzlichen Fähigkeiten. Eine Modifikation könnte deiner Waffe die Eigenschaft Vielseitig geben mit einer Schadensart, die die Waffe bereits austeilen kann, entweder durch ihren Grundschaden oder einer bestehenden Vielseitigkeit. Wenn du diese Modifikation auswählst, kannst du in diesem Fall stattdessen wählen, der Waffe die Eigenschaft Vielseitig für eine andere Schadensart zu geben: Hieb-, Stich- oder Wuchtschaden.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Befriedende Werkzeuge (nur Nahkampfwaffen):</strong> Weichere Materialien machen deine Waffe geeignet zum Ausschalten statt zum Töten, und spezielle Vorsprünge lassen dich Waffen abfangen und deine Feinde entwaffnen. Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaft Entwaffnen und Nichttödlich. Du kannst bei jedem Angriff wählen, ob du die Eigenschaft Nichttödlich mit deiner Innovation anwendest oder nicht.</li>\n<li><strong>Behindernde Stacheln (nur Nahkampfwaffen):</strong> Du hast deiner Waffe lange Stacheln hinzugefügt, die du benutzen kannst, um die Bewegungen deiner Feinde zu behindern. Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaften Behindernd und Vielseitig W.</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamische Gewichtung (nur einhändige Nahkampfwaffen; darf keine der Eigenschaften Agil, Befestigt oder Integriert haben):</strong> Die angepasste Gewichtsverteilung deiner Waffe kann die Schlagkraft erhöhen und erfordert dafür mehr Hände zum Führen. Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaft Zweihändig mit einem Schadenswürfel, der um eine Größe höher ist als der Schadenswürfel der Waffe (zum Beispiel würde ein Langschwert die Eigenschaft Zweihändig W10 erhalten). Deine Innovation erhält außerdem das Merkmal Vielseitig W.</li>\n<li><strong>Faltbar:</strong> Scharniere, Klammern und ausziehbare Teile machen deine Innovation verstellbar und ermögliche es, sie zusammenzufalten. Sie erhält die Eigenschaft Modular für Hieb-, Stich- und Wuchtschaden (S. 234). Du kannst Interagieren, um den Gegenstand auf leichte Last zu reduzieren oder wieder in seine normale Form zu bringen. Wenn der Gegenstand auf leichte Last gestellt ist, erhält er die Eigenschaft Verdeckbar, die dir einen Situationsbonus von +2 auf Fertigkeitswürfe und SG für Heimlichkeit zum Verstecken oder Verbergen der Waffe gibt.</li>\n<li><strong>Klobig (nur Nahkampfwaffen):</strong> Stumpfe Oberflächen und eine robuste Konstruktion machen deine Waffe schwer und keulenartig. Deine Innovation erhält die Merkmale Fortstoßen und Vielseitig W.</li>\n<li><strong>Komplexe Einfachheit (nur einfache Waffen):</strong> Erhöhe den Waffenschadenswürfel deiner Innovation um eine Stufe (W4 auf W6, W6 auf W8, W8 auf W10, W10 auf W12). Außerdem erhält sie eine der folgenden Merkmale deiner Wahl: Vielseitig H, Vielseitig S oder Vielseitig W</li>\n<li><strong>Modularer Kopf:</strong> Du hast eine Mehrzweck-Schlagfläche für deine Waffe gebaut oder du hast spezielle Munition hergestellt, die du schnell und einfach verändern kannst. Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaft Modular für Hieb-, Stich- und Wuchtschaden (S. 234). Wenn du die Eigenschaft Modular einsetzt, kannst du auch wählen, der Waffe die Eigenschaft Nichttödlich zu geben, wenn sie diese noch nicht hat, o d e r diese Eigenschaft zu entfernen, wenn sie derzeit nichttödlich ist.</li>\n<li><strong>Rasierzacken (nur Nahkampfwaffen):</strong> Du kannst Feinde mit scharfen, gebogenen Klingen, die deiner Waffe hinzugefügt wurden, ausschalten. Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaften Zu Fall Bringen und Vielseitig H.</li>\n<li><strong>Stumpfer Schuss (nur Fernkampfwaffen):</strong> Deine Waffeninnovation kann die Munition entschärfen und die stumpfe Kraft des Schusses anpassen, um bei Bedarf einen Angriff mit Wuchtschaden auszuführen oder um einen tödlichen Treffer mit einem ansonsten tödlichen Schuss zu vermeiden. Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaften Nichttödlich und Vielseitig W. Du kannst bei jedem Angriff wählen, ob du die Eigenschaft Nichttödlich deiner Innovation anwendest.</li>\n<li><strong>Verstrickungswaffe (nur Nahkampfwaffen):</strong> Du hast deine Waffe so verändert, dass sie Drähte oder Gurte einschließt, oder dass sie eine flexible Konstruktion aufweist. Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaften Ergreifen und Zu Fall Bringen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Explosion</h2>\n<p>Deine Innovation ist eine Schöpfung, die gerade noch von ihrer eigenen Technik zusammengehalten wird, immer am Rande des völligen Zusammenbruchs. Das birgt zwar ein gewisses Risiko, aber es bedeutet auch, dass du sie dazu bringen kannst, weit über ihre Spezifikationen hinaus zu funktionieren, insbesondere mit speziellen instabilen Aktionen. Siehe die Randspalte auf S. 17 für die Beschreibung der Eigenschaft Instabil und wie sie sich auf deine Innovation auswirkt.</p>\n<p>Erfinder können zwar im Laufe ihrer Karriere verschiedene instabile Handlungen erlernen, sie alle wissen aber zumindest, wie sie ihre Innovationen zum Explodieren bringen können.</p>\n<h2>Unvergleichlicher Erfinder</h2>\n<p>Du erfindest ständig Neues und dein handwerkliches Geschick ist unanfechtbar. Du erhältst das Fertigkeitstalent Erfinder, auch wenn du die Voraussetzungen dafür nicht erfüllst.</p>\n<h2>Schildblock</h2>\n<p>Du erhältst das allgemeine Talent Schildblock, eine Reaktion, mit der du Schaden mit deinem Schild reduzieren kannst.</p>\n<h2>Erfindertalente</h2>\n<p>Mit der 1. Stufe und dann jeder geraden Stufe erhältst du ein Erfindertalent. Einige Merkmale und Talente verwenden eine Auswahl an Gimmicks, die du bei dir trägst. Der Einfachheit halber bleiben diese abstrakt, aber wenn du aus irgendeinem Grund deiner Ausrüstung beraubt wirst, könntest du den Zugang zu vielen Merkmalen und Talenten verlieren, nach Ermessen des SL.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitstalente <span style=\"float: right;\">2.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 2. Stufe und jeder weiteren geraden Stufe erlangst du ein Fertigkeitstalent. Um ein Fertigkeitstalent wählen zu können, musst du wenigstens den Kompetenzgrad Geübt in der assoziierten Fertigkeit besitzen.</p>\n<h2>Allgemeine Talente <span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen erlangst du ein Allgemeines Talent.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitsverbesserungen <span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und jeder weiteren ungeraden Stufe erhältst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung. Du kannst eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung entweder nutzen, um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu erlangen oder um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu Experte zu verbessern.</p>\n<p>Mit der 7. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Experte zu Meister zu verbessern und mit der 15. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Meister zu Legende zu verbessern.</p>\n<h2>Rekonfigurieren<span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Du bist zum Experten in allen Handwerkskünsten geworden und passt deine Erfindungen ständig an. Du kannst versuchen, die Modifikationen zu ändern, indem du 1 Tag Auszeit zum Basteln aufwendest und einen Fertigkeitswurf für Handwerkskunst gegen den hohen SG für deine Stufe ablegst. Bei einem Erfolg kannst du eine Modifikation, die du für deine Innovation gewählt hast, in eine andere Modifikation der gleichen Art (anfänglich, bahnbrechend oder revolutionär) verändern.</p>\n<p>Wenn du über Modifikationstalente verfügst, kannst du bei einem erfolgreichen Wurf wählen, ob du stattdessen ein Modifikationstalent für ein anderes Modifikationstalent umlernen willst. Die neue Fähigkeit muss die Standardeinschränkungen für Umlernen erfüllen.</p>\n<h2>Schnellgangexpertise <span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Du hast deine Fertigkeiten in Handwerkskunst verbessert und kannst deine Geräte in einen leistungsfähigeren Schnellgang versetzen. Du erhältst den Kompetenzgrad Experte in Handwerkskunst, und bei einem erfolgreichen Einsatz von Schnellgang erhöhst du den zusätzlichen Schaden um 1.</p>\n<h2>Abstammungstalente <span style=\"float: right;\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Neben dem Abstammungstalent, mit dem du das Spiel beginnst, erhältst du mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen ein Abstammungstalent.</p>\n<h2>Attributsverbesserungen <span style=\"float: right;\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 5 Stufen verbesserst du vier unterschiedliche Attributswerte. Du kannst auf diese Weise Attributswerte über 18 erhöhen. Sollte ein Attributswert unter 18 liegen, wird er mit einer Attributsverbesserung um 2 erhöht, andernfalls um 1.</p>\n<h2>Erfinderwaffenexpertise <span style=\"float: right;\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Du entwickelst Tricks, um deine Waffen effektiver zu nutzen. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Einfache Waffen, Kriegswaffen und Waffenlose Angriffe verbessert sich zu Experte. Wenn du eine Waffeninnovation hast, erhältst du Zugang zu dem Kritischen Spezialisierungseffekt deiner Innovation.</p>\n<h2>Bahnbrechende Innovation <span style=\"float: right;\">7.</span></h2>\n<p>Du hast einen Durchbruch in deinem Studienfach erzielt und eine machtvolle neue Methode entdeckt, um deine Innovation zu verbessern. Wähle eine bahnbrechende Modifikation deines Innovationstyps und wende sie auf deine Innovation an. Du kannst auch eine anfängliche Modifikation des Innovationstyps deiner Innovation wählen, wenn du dies bevorzugst.</p>\n<h3>Bahnbrechende Konstruktmodifikationen</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Antimagische Konstruktion:</strong> Ob du nun eine geschickte Anpassung des Magie negierenden, als Noqual bekannten Himmelmetalls vorgenommen oder magische Schutzmechanismen entwickelt hast, du hast deine Innovation sehr widerstandsfähig gegenüber Zaubern gemacht. Dein Konstrukt erhält einen Situationsbonus von +2 auf alle Rettungswürfe und die RK gegen Zauber.</li>\n<li><strong>Geschützkonfiguration:</strong> Deine Innovation kann sich von einem mobilen Konstrukt in einen stationären Geschützturm verwandeln. Dein Konstruktgefährte kann sich mit einer einzelnen Aktion der Kategorie Manipulieren verwandeln. Dabei verwandelt er sich in einen Geschützturm in seinem Feld (oder von einem Turm in seine normale Gestalt zurück). Solange sie ein Geschützturm ist, hat deine Innovation den Zustand @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Bewegungsunfähig}, aber der Schadenswürfel ihres Projektilwerfers erhöht sich auf 1W6 und die Entfernungseinheit verbessert sich auf 60 Fuß/18 m. Du musst über die Modifikation Projektilwerfer verfügen, um diese Modifikation zu wählen.</li>\n<li><strong>Großartiges Gerät:</strong> Der Kompetenzgrad deines Konstrukts für Einschüchterung, Heimlichkeit und Überlebenskunde erhöht sich auf Experte. Für jede dieser Fertigkeiten, in der es bereits den Kompetenzgrad Experte hat (z. B. weil es ein Verbesserter Konstruktgefährte ist), erhält es stattdessen den Kompetenzgrad Meister. Wenn du das Klassenmerkmal Revolutionäre Innovation besitzt, verbessert sich dieser Kompetenzgrad auf Meister oder Legende, wenn deine Konstruktinnovation bereits den Kompetenzgrad Experte hatte. Du musst die Modifikation Erstaunliches Gerät besitzen, um diese Modifikation wählen zu können.</li>\n<li><strong>Klettergliedmaßen:</strong> Mit Gliedmaßen, die Krallen gleichen oder sich festsaugen können, wird dein Konstrukt zu einem fähigen Kletterer. Deine Innovation erhält eine Bewegungsrate für Klettern in Höhe der Hälfte seiner Bewegungsrate.</li>\n<li><strong>Strapazierfähige Konstruktion:</strong> Deine Innovation ist solide gebaut; sie kann beträchtlichen Schaden aushalten, bevor sie zerstört wird. Erhöhe ihre maximalen TP um deine Stufe.</li>\n<li><strong>Verbesserte Bewaffnung:</strong> Du hast die Waffen deines Konstrukts verstärkt. Wähle einen der Waffenlosen Angriffe deines Konstrukts, der eine anfängliche Waffenmodifikation deiner Wahl erhält, die du aus der Liste auf S. 18 oder aus anderen anfänglichen Waffenmodifikationen, zu denen du Zugang hast, aussuchst. Der Waffenlose Angriff muss alle Voraussetzungen für die gewählte Eigenschaft erfüllen (z. B. Nahkampfangriff für Verstrickende Form), und da es ein Waffenloser Angriff ist, kann er bestimmte Anforderungen niemals erfüllen, wie z. B. einfache Waffe für Komplizierte Einfachheit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bahnbrechende Rüstungsmodifikationen</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Antimagische Panzerung:</strong> Ob du nun eine clevere Anpassung des magienegierenden, als Noqual bekannten Himmelsmetalls nutzt oder selbst entworfene magische Schutzmechanismen, du hast deine Rüstung gegen Magie gestärkt. Wenn du die Rüstung trägst, erhältst du einen Situationsbonus von +1 auf alle Rettungswürfe gegen Zauber und auf deine RK gegen Zauber. Gegen Zauber, die direkt auf die Rüstung zielen (wie z. B. Metall erhitzen), erhältst du stattdessen einen Situationsbonus von +4 auf alle Rettungswürfe und auf deine RK.</li>\n<li><strong>Aktive Tarnung (nur Trickrüstung):</strong> Du hast das Äußere deiner Rüstung so modifiziert, dass du mühelos mit deiner Umgebung verschmelzen kannst, solange du stillhältst. Wenn du deine Rüstung trägst, kannst du dich auch ohne Deckung oder Tarnung Verstecken, da sich die Pigmentierung an deine Umgebung anpasst.</li>\n<li><strong>Hyperverstärker:</strong> Du hast die Leistung deines Geschwindigkeitsantriebes durch einen Durchbruch verbessert, der den Energiedurchfluss erhöht, ohne dass er zu explodieren droht. Du erhältst einen Zustandsbonus von +10 Fuß/3 m auf deine Bewegungsrate. Wenn du unter dem Effekt von Schnellgang stehst, erhöht sich dieser Zustandsbonus auf +20 Fuß/6 m. Wenn du den Kompetenzgrad Legende in Handwerkskunst hast, erhöht sich dieser Zustandsbonus auf +30 Fuß/9 m, du unter dem Effekt von Schnellgang stehst. Du musst über die Modifikation Erhöhte Geschwindigkeit verfügen, um diese Modifikation zu wählen.</li>\n<li><strong>Kinetische Absorption:</strong> Du hast die Zugfestigkeit deiner Rüstung verbessert, sodass sie sich bei Angriffen mit Wuchtschaden dehnt. Wenn du deine Rüstung trägst, erhältst du eine Resistenz gegen Wuchtschaden in Höhe deiner halben Stufe.</li>\n<li><strong>Kompakte Panzerung:</strong> Du hast deine Rüstung mit einer robusten Panzerung versehen. Wenn du deine Rüstung trägst, erhältst du Resistenz gegen Hiebschaden in Höhe der Hälfte deiner Stufe.</li>\n<li><strong>Mehrschichtiges Geflecht:</strong> Du hast ein unglaublich starkes Netz aus ineinandergreifenden Maschen um deine Rüstung gewoben, welches Angriffe mit Stichschaden abfängt und zerstreut. Wenn du deine Rüstung trägst, erhältst du Resistenz gegen Stichschaden in Höhe deiner halben Stufe.</li>\n<li><strong>Schwere Konstruktion (nur Kraftrüstung): </strong> Du hast deine Innovation zu einem schweren Bollwerk ausgebaut, und deine bahnbrechende Konstruktion sorgt dafür, dass du keine der Nachteile eines derart schweren Schutzes in Kauf nehmen musst. Deine Innovation wird zu einer schweren Rüstung, und dein Kompetenzgrad für deine Rüstungsinnovation (aber nicht für andere schwere Rüstungen) steigt auf den gleichen Grad wie dein Kompetenzgrad für Mittelschwere Rüstung. Wenn dein Stärkemodifikator mindestens +3 beträgt, wird der Malus auf deine Bewegungsrate vollständig aufgehoben, statt ihn nur um -5 Fuß/1,50 m zu reduzieren. Die angepassten Werte der Rüstung sind wie folgt: RK-Bonus +5; GE-Limit +1; Rüstungsmalus -2; Rüstungsbewegungsmalus -10 Fuß/3 m; Stärke +3; Last 3; Gruppe Mehrschichtig; Rüstungseigenschaften Bollwerk.</li>\n<li><strong>Verbesserte Resistenz:</strong> Du hast die anfängliche Fähigkeit deiner Modifikation, Schaden zu widerstehen, verbessert. Die Resistenz deiner anfänglichen Rüstungsmodifikation fügt deine volle Stufe hinzu, statt nur der Hälfte deiner Stufe (z. B. würde die Resistenz des Phlogistonregulators sich auf deine Stufe erhöhen). Wenn du mehr als eine anfängliche Modifikation hast, die Resistenz verleiht, wähle, auf welche dies zutrifft.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bahnbrechende Waffenmodifikationen</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aerodynamische Konstruktion (nur Nahkampfwaffen):</strong> Du entwickelst die Form deiner Waffe sorgfältig, sodass sie bei Angriffen auf aufeinanderfolgende Ziele ihre Dynamik behält.

Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaft freihändig.</li>\n<li><strong>Mannigfache Legierung:</strong> Du hast mehrere Legierungen entwickelt, die nützliche Eigenschaften verschiedener Metalle enthalten, und du ersetzt eine Reihe von Teilen deiner Waffe oder ihrer Munition durch Teile aus diesen Legierungen. Deine Waffeninnovation ist aus Kaltem Eisen und aus Silber. Das bedeutet, dass du mehr Schaden bei einer Vielzahl von übernatürlichen Kreaturen wie Dämonen, Teufeln und Feen verursachst.</li>\n<li><strong>Seilwerfer (nur Fernkampfwaffen):</strong> Deine Waffe kann Projektile abschießen, die sich als einfache Seile oder Netze um die Beine deiner Feinde wickeln, um deine Ziele so zu Boden zu reißen. Außerdem kannst du mit den in der Waffe eingebauten Enterhaken klettern. Deine Waffeninnovation erhält die Eigenschaften Klettern und Zu Fall bringender Fernkampfangriff (siehe Randspalte S. 17).</li>\n<li><strong>Unauffälliges Äußeres (nur Nahkampfwaffen):</strong> Deine Innovation ist darauf ausgelegt, sich leicht verstecken lassen und überraschende Angriffe zu ermöglichen. Sie erhält die Eigenschaften Heimtückisch und Vielseitig S. Wenn die Waffe Leichte Last hat, erhält sie außerdem die Eigenschaft Verdeckbar.</li>\n<li><strong>Verbesserte Zielvorrichtung (nur Fernkampfwaffen):</strong> Ein sorgfältig abgestimmtes Zielfernrohr oder Zielgerät erlaubt es deiner Waffe, Schwachstellen besonders gut zu treffen. Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaft Heimtückisch (S. 232) und erhöht ihre Entfernungseinheit um 3 m.</li>\n<li><strong>Wurfleine (nur Waffen mit der Eigenschaft Wurfwaffe):</strong> Deine Waffe hat eine ausziehbare Leine, mit der du deine Feinde umwerfen und die Waffe schnell wieder in deine Hand zurückholen kannst. Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaft Zu Fall bringender Fernkampfangriff und Einholbar (siehe Randspalte S. 17).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Blitzschnelle Reflexe <span style=\"float: right;\">7.</span></h2>\n<p>Deine Reflexe sind schnell wie der Blitz.

Dein Kompetenzgrad für deinen Erfinder-SG steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Offensive Verbesserung <span style=\"float: right;\">9.</span></h2>\n<p>Du hast deine Innovation erweitert, um deine offensiven Fähigkeiten zu verbessern. Deine Verbesserungen bewirken, dass alle Angriffe, die sich auf deine Innovation stützen, 1W6 zusätzlichen Schaden verursachen. Die Schadensart richtet sich dabei nach der von dir gewählten Verbesserung. Wenn deine Innovation eine Rüstung ist, gilt die Verbesserung für deine waffenlosen Nahkampfangriffe sowie deine Nahkampfangriffe mit einer Waffe, die du während deiner täglichen Vorbereitungen wählst. Wenn deine Innovation ein Konstrukt ist, gilt die Verbesserung für die Angriffe deines Konstruktgefährten. Wenn deine Innovation eine Waffe ist, gilt die Verbesserung für Angriffe mit deiner Innovation. Du kannst Auszeit nutzen, um zu einer anderen Verbesserung zu wechseln, genauso wie du deine Modifikation wechseln kannst. Wähle eine der folgenden Verbesserung, die jeweilige Schadensart ist in Klammern angegeben.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blitz (Elektrizitätsschaden):</strong> Deine Innovation trifft Feinde mit Ladungen von Elektrizität.</li>\n<li><strong>Frost (Kälteschaden):</strong> Deine Innovation absorbiert Hitze rapide und verursacht eine intensive Kälte.</li>\n<li><strong>Säge (Hiebschaden):</strong> Deine Innovation enthüllt während ihres Angriffs sich drehende Sägeblätter.</li>\n<li><strong>Schwung (Wuchtschaden):</strong> Deine Innovation trifft Gegner mit zusätzlichem Schwung.</li>\n<li><strong>Stachel (Stichschaden):</strong> Deine Innovation enthüllt während eines Angriffs hinterhältige Stacheln.</li>\n<li><strong>Vitriol (Säureschaden):</strong> Deine Innovation spritzt Strahlen ätzender Säure aus.</li>\n<li><strong>Zündung (Feuerschaden):</strong> Deine Innovation schießt Strahlen sengender Flammen ab.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Mittelschwere Rüstungsexpertise<span style=\"float: right;\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Du hast gelernt, dich besser gegen Angriffe zu verteidigen. Deine Kompetenzgrad für Umgang mit leichter Rüstung, mittelschwerer Rüstung und für Ungerüstete Verteidigung steigen auf Experte.</p>\n<p>Wenn du eine mittelschwere oder schwere Rüstungsinnovation hast, erhältst du Zugang zu dem Kritischen Spezialisierungseffekt deiner Rüstungsinnovation.</p>\n<h2>Entschlossenheit<span style=\"float: right;\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Verstand wurde mit Entschlossenheit gestählt.

Dein Kompetenzgrad für Wahrnehmung steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Vollständiges Rekonfigurieren <span style=\"float: right;\">13.</span></h2>\n<p>Wenn es um Handwerkskunst und Basteln geht, bist du unglaublich geschickt darin, deine Modifikationen zu verändern, um die Funktionalität deiner Innovation anzupassen. Wenn du Auszeit aufwendest, um deine Innovation zu überarbeiten und einen erfolgreichen Fertigkeitswurf für Handwerkskunst ablegst, kannst du eine beliebige Anzahl von Modifikationen austauschen, deine Offensive Verbesserung austauschen oder eine beliebige Anzahl von Modifikationsfähigkeiten umlernen, statt nur eine. Du darfst trotzdem eine Modifikation nur gegen eine Modifikation desselben Typs austauschen (anfänglich, bahnbrechend oder revolutionär).</p>\n<h2>Erfinderwaffenmeisterschaft <span style=\"float: right;\">13.</span></h2>\n<p>Du kennst deine Waffen genau. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Einfache Waffen, Kriegswaffen und Waffenlose Angriffe verbessert sich zu Meister.</p>\n<h2>Mächtige Waffenspezialisierung <span style=\"float: right;\">15.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Zusatzschaden aus Waffenspezialisierung steigt bei Waffen und Waffenlosen Angriffen, in denen du den Kompetenzgrad Experte besitzt, auf 4.

Dein Kompetenzgrad für Handwerkskunst verbessert sich zu Legende, und bei einem erfolgreichen Schnellgang erhöhst du den zusätzlichen Schaden um insgesamt 3. Dies ersetzt die Erhöhung von Schnellgangmeisterschaft.</p>\n<h2>Revolutionäre Innovation <span style=\"float: right;\">15.</span></h2>\n<p>Du bist ein unvergleichliches Genie und hast eine Technik entdeckt, die dein Fachgebiet revolutionieren wird - oder zumindest fürs Erste deine Innovation! Wähle eine revolutionä- re Modifikation, die du auf deine Innovation anwendest. Du kannst auch eine anfängliche oder bahnbrechende Modifikation desselben Typs wählen, wenn du dies bevorzugst.</p>\n<h3>Revolutionäre Konstruktmodifikationen</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flugchassis:</strong> Du kannst dein Konstrukt mit einem Fluggerät ausstatten, z. B. mit Rotoren oder mit Flügeln und einer leichten Konstruktion. Deine Innovation erhält eine Bewegungsrate für Fliegen von 25 Fuß/7,50 m.</li>\n<li><strong>Mauerkonfiguration:</strong> Deine Innovation kann sich von einem mobilen Konstrukt zu einer stationären Stellung auf dem Schlachtfeld wandeln. Sie kann sich als Aktivität für 2 Aktionen mit der Eigenschaft Handhaben auseinanderfalten, wobei sie sich von ihrer üblichen Form in eine dünne, gerade Wand aus Metall und Zahnrädern mit bis zu 3 m Höhe und 10 m Länge transformieren kann. Die Wand muss sich durch das ursprüngliche Feld deiner Innovation erstrecken. Während dein Konstrukt eine Wand ist, kann es keine Aktionen ausführen, außer sich mit der gleichen Aktivität wieder zurückzuverwandeln. Weiterhin kann es sich nicht gut verteidigen, und erhält daher den Zustand @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Auf dem Falschen Fuß} und zusätzlich einen Zustandsmalus von -2 auf seine RK. Die Wand blockiert die Sichtlinie und Effekte, es sei denn, deine Innovation hat nur noch die Hälfte ihrer maximalen TP oder weniger. Dann ermöglichen es Löcher in der Wand Kreaturen, hindurchzusehen und aus der Deckung heraus anzugreifen, und Winzige Kreaturen können hindurchschlüpfen.</li>\n<li><strong>Resistenter Überzug:</strong> Deine Innovation ist schwer zu beschädigen, egal mit welchen Mitteln. Sie erhält Resistenz von 5 gegen jede Schadensart (außer Adamant).</li>\n<li><strong>Runenfassung:</strong> Du hast ein Gerät in deine Innovation eingebaut, das einem Runenstein ähnelt und eine Eigenschaftsrune tragen kann, auch wenn es sich nicht um eine Waffe oder eine Rüstung handelt. Eine Rüstungseigenschaftsrune beeinflusst deine Innovation so, wie sie den Träger der Rüstung betrifft. Eine Waffeneigenschaftsrune gewährt alle Eigenschaften, die sie normalerweise einer Waffe verleihen würde, auf Waffenlose Angriffe deiner Innovation, Dabei müssen diese Angriffe den normalen Anforderungen der Rune genügen (z. B. wäre eine Vorpal-Rune nur anwendbar auf Waffenlose Nahkampfangriffe, die Hiebschaden anrichten). Wirkt die Rune nur auf Fernkampfangriffe, hat sie keine Wirkung, es sei denn, deine Innovation hat einen eingebauten Fernkampfangriff (z. B. durch die anfängliche Modifikation Projektilwerfer). Wenn die Rune die physische Form oder das Aussehen der Waffe oder der Rüstung beeinflussen würde, wie z. B. Unscheinbar, hat die Rune keine Wirkung, wenn sie in dein Konstrukt geätzt wird.</li>\n<li><strong>Wundersames Gerät:</strong> Du hast den Kortex deiner Innovation perfektionierst, sodass sie um einiges intelligenter geworden ist. Ihre Intelligenz steigt um 2, und sie lernt eine Sprache deiner Wahl aus den Sprachen, die du kennst. Dein Konstrukt erhält die Fähigkeit, Aktionen auszuführen, die eine höhere Intelligenz erfordern, wie Bedrängen und Schrift entziffern. Schließlich erhält dein Konstrukt den Kompetenzgrad Legende in zwei Intelligenz- oder Charismabasierten Fertigkeiten deiner Wahl. Du musst die Modifikation Großartiges Gerät haben, um diese Modifikation wählen zu können.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Revolutionäre Rrüstungsmodifikationen</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automatisches Hindernis:</strong> Deine Rüstung verwendet elektromagnetische Felder, subharmonische Verzerrungen oder andere Techniken, um es Kreaturen in deiner Nähe zu erschweren, sich zu bewegen, es sei denn, du erlaubst es ihnen. Wenn du deine Rüstung trägst, sind alle Felder, die an dich angrenzen, für deine Feinde Schwieriges Gelände.</li>\n<li><strong>Energiebarriere:</strong> Die Abwehrkräfte deiner Rüstung absorbieren jede Art von Energie, die auf dich einwirkt. Wenn du die Rüstung trägst, erhältst du Resistenz gegen jeglichen Energieschaden (Elektrizitäts-, Feuer-, Kälte-, Kraft-, Lebens-, Leeren-, Säure- und Schallschaden) in Höhe deiner halben Stufe +2. Du musst eine der Modifikation Harmonischer Oszillator, Metallische Reaktanz oder Phlogistonregulator haben, um diese Modifikation wählen zu können.</li>\n<li><strong>Multisensorische Maskierung (nur Trickrüstung):</strong> Du hast eine multisensorische Maske über deine Rüstung gebaut, die dich schützt, indem sie deine Gestalt vor allen Sinnen verzerrt, sodass nur ein verschwommenes Bild, dumpfe Geräusche und so weiter wahrnehmbar sind. Wenn du die Rüstung trägst, erhältst du den Zustand Verborgen vor allen Kreaturen, selbst wenn sie einen nicht-visuellen, präzisen Sinn benutzen, wie z. B. das Echolot einer Fledermaus. Wie üblich bei Effekten, die deinen Ort offenbaren, kannst du diese Verschleierung nicht zum Verstecken oder Schleichen verwenden. Wenn du eine feindliche Aktion ausführst, endet die Verschleierung, bis du die Maske mit einer einzelnen Aktion mit der Kategorie Handhaben wiederherstellst.</li>\n<li><strong>Perfekte Befestigung (nur Kraftrüstung):</strong> Du hast deine Rüstung mit so schweren Befestigungen ausgestattet, dass tödliche Angriffe oft ihre Wirkung verlieren. Lege jedes Mal, wenn du Kritisch getroffen wirst, während du die Rüstung trägst, einen @Check[flat|dc:13|showDC:owner]{Einfachen Wurf} ab. Bei einem Erfolg wird der Treffer zu einem normalen Treffer. Dies ist nicht kumulativ mit Verstärkt-Runen oder anderen Fähigkeiten, die Kritische Treffer mit einem einfachen Wurf reduzieren. Zusätzlich erhältst du Resistenz 2 + die Hälfte deiner Stufe gegen Präzisionsschaden.</li>\n<li><strong>Physischer Schutz:</strong> Deine Rüstung hat so viele Anpassungen und Vorkehrungen, dass sie gegen alle physischen Schäden schützen kann. Wenn du deine Rüstung trägst, erhältst du Resistenz gegen jeden körperlichen Schaden (Hieb-, Stich- und Wuchtschaden, sowie Anhaltenden Blutungsschaden) in Höhe deiner halben Stufe. Du musst über die bahnbrechenden Modifikationen Kinetische Absorption, Kompakte Panzerung oder Mehrschichtiges Geflecht verfügen, um diese Modifikation wählen zu können.</li>\n<li><strong>Runenkapazität:</strong> Ob du nun mit Legierungen mit Orichalcum oder einer anderen technischen Lösung herumgepfuscht hast, du hast deine Innovation so gebaut, dass sie eine zusätzliche Eigenschaftsrune tragen kann. Deine Innovation kann eine Eigenschaftsrune mehr haben als ein normaler Gegenstand seiner Art (maximal vier Eigenschaftsrunen mit einer +3 Rüstungsverbesserung).</li>\n<li><strong>Unglaubliche Resistenz:</strong> Du hast dich in deiner bahnbrechenden Modifikation, Schaden zu widerstehen, verbessert. Wähle eine der folgenden bahnbrechenden Modifikationen, die deine Innovation aufweist: Kinetische Absorption, Kompakte Panzerung oder Mehrschichtiges Geflecht. Erhöhe die Resistenz, die du durch diese Modifikation erhältst, auf gleich deiner Stufe, statt der Hälfte deiner Stufe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Revolutionäre Waffenmodifikationen</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Angriffsverbesserer:</strong> Deine Waffe kalibriert sich nach jedem fehlgeschlagenen Angriff selbst neu, um sicherzustellen, dass der nächste Angriff richtig landet. Deine Innovation erhält die die Eigenschaften Schwung und Fortstoßen.</li>\n<li><strong>Ausfahrbare Waffe (nur Nahkampfwaffen):</strong> Du hast einen Weg gefunden, deine Waffe so zu konstruieren, dass sie verlängert werden kann, ihr Gleichgewicht dabei aber unverändert bleibt. Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaft Reichweite. Wenn die Waffe bereits die Eigenschaft Reichweite hatte, erhöht sie deinen Angriffsradius um zusätzliche 10 Fuß/3 m, statt der üblichen zusätzlichen 5 Fuß/1,50 m.</li>\n<li><strong>Erweiterter Schaden:</strong> Du hast deine Innovation stärker gemacht als andere Waffen ihrer Art. Erhöhe den Waffenschadenwürfel deiner Innovation um eine Stufe (W4 auf W6, W6 auf W8, W8 auf W10, W10 auf W12). Wie üblich kannst du deinen Würfel nicht um mehr als eine Größe erhöhen, daher ist diese Modifikation nicht kumulativ mit Komplizierter Einfachheit.</li>\n<li><strong>Gefährlicher Angriff:</strong> Durch präzise Berechnung hast du die perfekte Form für deine Waffe gefunden, um mit einem gut platzierten Schlag extremen Schaden anzurichten. Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaft Gefährlich W8. Wenn deine Innovation bereits gefährlich war, erhöht sie ihren Würfel für Gefährlich auf W12, statt Gefährlich W8 zu erhalten.</li>\n<li><strong>Reichweitenstabilisator (nur Fernkampfwaffen):</strong> Du hast deine Innovation so modifiziert, dass sie gefährlich und auf jede Entfernung wirksam ist. Wenn deine Innovation die Eigenschaft Ballistisch hatte, entferne diese Eigenschaft. Andernfalls erhöhe die Entfernungseinheit deiner Innovation um 50 Fuß/15 m oder um einen Betrag in Höhe der ersten Entfernungseinheit der Waffe, je nachdem, welcher Wert höher ist.</li>\n<li><strong>Runenkapazität:</strong> Ob du nun mit Legierungen mit Orichalcum oder einer anderen technischen Lösung herumgepfuscht hast, du hast deine Innovation so gebaut, dass sie eine zusätzliche Eigenschaftsrune tragen kann. Deine Innovation kann eine Eigenschaftsrune mehr haben als ein normaler Gegenstand seiner Art (maximal vier Eigenschaftsrunen mit einer +3 Waffenverbesserung).</li>\n<li><strong>Schwungverstärker:</strong> Eine speziell gewichtete Vorrichtung sorgt dafür, dass die Waffe beim Angriff mehr Schwung erhält. Deine Innovation erhält die Eigenschaften Dynamisch und Vielseitig W.</li>\n<li><strong>Unmögliche Legierung:</strong> Andere Erfinder behaupten, es sei technisch unmöglich, aber du hast es geschafft, verschieden Metalllegierungen zu schaffen, die nur für dich zu funktionieren scheinen. Diese Legierungen können Gegner schädigen, die anfällig für eines der sieben Himmelsmetalle sind. Deine Innovation wird wie alle sieben Himmelsmetalle behandelt (Abysium, Adamant, Djezet, Inubrix, Noqual, Orichalcum und Siccatit). Das bedeutet, dass du bei einer Vielzahl von Kreaturen mehr Schaden verursachst, allerdings kannst du keine der anderen Spezialeffekte für Waffen aus diesen Himmelsmetallen anwenden.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Erfindermeisterschaft <span style=\"float: right;\">17.</span></h2>\n<p>Deine Erfindungen sind unglaublich effektiv. Dein Kompetenzgrad für deinen Erfinder-SG steigt auf Meister.</p>\n<h2>Gestählt <span style=\"float: right;\">17.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Körper ist an körperliche Strapazen gewöhnt und resistent gegen Krankheiten. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zähigkeitswürfe verbessert sich zu Meister. Erzielst du bei einem Zähigkeitswurf einen Erfolg, so zählt dies als Kritischer Erfolg.</p>\n<h2>Unbegrenzte Erfindung <span style=\"float: right;\">19.</span></h2>\n<p>Deine Fähigkeit, deine Innovation anzupassen, hat eine unmögliche Höhe erreicht, und du kannst diese Fähigkeiten nutzen, um in deiner Freizeit wichtige Anpassungen vorzunehmen. Während deiner täglichen Vorbereitungen kannst du deine Innovation automatisch ersetzen, wenn sie zerstört oder kaputt ist. Darüber hinaus kannst du auf eine andere Innovation wechseln (Konstrukt, Rüstung, Waffe oder ein anderer Typ, zu dem du Zugang hast) und deine Modifikationen und deine Offensive Verbesserung austauschen.</p>\n<p>Falls du Talente hast, die deine vorherige Innovation als Voraussetzung hatten, kannst du sie so lange nicht mehr einsetzen, bis du diese Talente normal umgelernt hast. Es kostet dich jedoch statt 1 Woche nur 1 Tag Auszeit, ein solches Talent in ein Talent umzulernen, das deine neue Innovation als Voraussetzung hat.</p>\n<h2>Mittelschwere Rüstungsmeisterschaft <span style=\"float: right;\">19.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Geschick im Umgang mit Rüstungen verbessert sich und du kannst mehr Schläge vermeiden. Deine Kompetenzgrad für Umgang mit leichter Rüstung, mittelschwerer Rüstung und für Ungerüstete Verteidigung steigen auf Meister.</p>"

Stufe erlangst du die Vorteile deiner gewählten Abstammung und deines Hintergrundes.</p>\n<h2>Attributsverbesserungen</h2>\n<p>Neben der Attributsverbesserung durch deine Klasse erhältst du mit der 1. Stufe vier freie Verbesserungen auf unterschiedliche Attributsmodifikatoren.</p>\n<p>Mit der 5. Stufe und dann jeweils alle weiteren 5 Stufen erhältst du vier freie Verbesserungen auf unterschiedliche Attributsmodifikatoren. Sollte ein Attributsmodifikator bereits einen Wert von +4 oder höher aufweisen, musst du zum Steigern zwei Verbesserungen aufwenden; diese beiden Verbesserungen müssen nicht mit derselben Stufe aufgewandt werden, der Modifikator steigt aber erst mit der zweiten Verbesserung.</p>\n<h2>Anfangskompetenzgrade</h2>\n<p>Mit der 1. Stufe erlangst du eine Reihe von Kompetenzgraden, die deine Grundausbildung repräsentieren. Du findest sie am Beginn dieser Klassenbeschreibung.</p>\n<h2>Kinetisches Tor</h2>\n<p>Als Kinetiker hast du ein Kinetisches Portal in dir erweckt oder geöffnet, welches auf übernatürliche Weise deinen Körper mit den Elementarebenen verbindet, so dass du durch es Elementarkräfte fokussieren kannst. Wähle mit der 1. Stufe entweder das Einfache Portal (ein Element) oder das Doppelportal (zwei Elemente).</p>\n<p>Wenn du ein Element für dein Kinetisches Portal wählst, hast du die Auswahl aus Erde, Feuer, Holz, Luft, Metall und Wasser. Elemente, die du fokussieren kannst, werden als deine Kinetischen Elemente bezeichnet. Deine Kinetischen Elemente funktionieren auch an Orten, wo sie normalerweise versagen würden - du könntest z.B. Luft in einem Vakuum erschaffen oder Feuer unter Wasser.</p>\n<p>Dein Kinetisches Portal verleiht dir Impulstalente; mit diesen magischen Handlungen kannst du deine Elemente auf atemberaubende Weise formen und lenken. Du kannst Impulstalente als Kinetikerklassentalente erlangen, wie unter Impulse beschrieben. Auf höheren Stufen verleiht dir das Klassenmerkmal Portalverbesserung weitere Impulstalente und lässt dich wählen, ob du dein Können mit einem Element verbessern oder Zugang zu neuen Kinetischen Elementen erlangen willst.</p>\n<h3>Einfaches Portal</h3>\n<p>Dein Kinetisches Portal verbindet dich mit einer Elementarebene; du beginnst mit einem einzelnen Element, besitzt darüber aber größere Macht. Wähle ein Element als dein Kinetisches Element und wähle zwei Impulstalente der 1. Stufe, welche die entsprechende Elementkategorie aufweisen.</p>\n<p>Ferner erlangst du einen Vorteil, wenn du Impuls deines gewählten Talents nutzt, die 2 oder mehr Aktionen benötigen, in Form eines Impulsschubes. Dieser Impulsschub tritt vor allen anderen Effekten des Impulses ein, außer es ist anderswo anders vermerkt. Du kannst nur einen Impulsschub pro Runde erhalten.</p>\n<p><strong>Erde</strong> Steinfragmente schweben um dich herum und verleihen dir bis zum Beginn deines nächsten Zuges einen Situationsbonus von +1 auf deine RK.</p>\n<p><strong>Feuer</strong> Erhöhe den Schadenswürfel des Feuerschadens, den der Impuls verursacht, um einen Schritt.</p>\n<p><strong>Holz</strong> Du erlangst Temporäre Trefferpunkte in Höhe deiner Stufe bis zum Beginn deines nächsten Zuges.</p>\n<p><strong>Luft</strong> Vor oder nach den anderen Effekten des Impulses kannst du entweder die Aktion Schritt nutzen oder um maximal deine halbe Bewegungsrate Laufen. Falls du eine Bewegungsrate für Fliegen besitzt, kannst du alternative um maximal deine halbe Bewegungsrate Fliegen.</p>\n<p><strong>Metall</strong> Wähle Elektrizitäts-, Säure- oder Stichschaden. Bis zum Beginn deines nächsten Zuges erleidet jede Kreatur, die dich berührt oder dir mit einem Waffenlosen Nahkampfangriff oder einer Nahkampfwaffe ohne Reichweite Schaden zufügt, Schaden der gewählten Art in Höhe deiner halben Stufe (Minimum 1 Schadenspunkt).</p>\n<p><strong>Wasser</strong> Nach Eintreten der anderen Effekte des Impulses kannst du eine Kreatur, die Ziel des Impulses war oder sich innerhalb seines Wirkungsbereiches befunden hat, um 5 Fuß/1,50 m in eine beliebige Richtung bewegen (oder um 10 Fuß/3 m, sollte sich das Ziel in einem Gewässer befinden). Dies kann die Kreatur nicht in die Luft bewegen. Du kannst nur eine Kreatur wählen, die entweder bewegt werden möchte, deren Rettungswurf gegen den Impuls misslungen ist oder gegen die dir ein Impulsangriffswurf gelungen ist.</p>\n<h3>Doppelportal</h3>\n<p>Dein Kinetisches Portal ist eine harmonische Verbindung zu zwei Ebenen und gestattet dir, die fraglichen Elemente zu kombinieren, was dir Zugang zu vielseitigen Fähigkeiten verleiht. Wähle zwei Elemente als deine Kinetischen Elemente. Dann wähle ein Impulstalent der 1. Stufe mit der zum ersten Element passenden Kategorie und ein weiteres mit zum zweiten Element passender Kategorie.</p>\n<h2>Kinetische Aura</h2>\n<p>Elemente fließen durch dein Kinetisches Portal von einer Elementarebene und umkreisen dich. Die Form und das Aussehen dieser Kinetischen Aura sind für dich einzigartig. So könnte ein chaotischer Wind dich umwehen, könnten Erdbrocken um dich kreisen, Feuerfunken, in stetiger Veränderung befindliche Metallsterne, Schneeflocken oder dergleichen. Falls du mehr als ein Element fokussieren kannst, so sind alle deine Kinetischen Elemente in der Aura vertreten.</p>\n<p>Du verfügst über die Aktion @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.g8QrV39TmZfkbXgE]{Elemente fokussieren}, mit der du deine Kinetische Aura aktivieren kannst</p>\n<h2>Impuls</h2>\n<p>Ein Impuls ist eine besondere Art magischer Handlung, die Kinetikern verfügbar ist und ihnen gestattet, ihre Kinetischen Elemente einzusetzen oder zu unterschiedlichen und mächtigen Manifestationen zu formen. Um ein Element zu führen, muss deine Kinetische Aura aktiv sein und du musst über eine freie Hand verfügen (wie unter der Kategorie Impuls beschrieben). Du erlangst automatisch die Elementargeschoss- und Einfache Kinese-Talente. Deine bei Kinetisches Portal getroffene Wahl verleiht dir weitere Impulstalente. Du kannst weitere Impulstalente als Kinetikerklassentalente wählen und erlangst auf höheren Stufen automatisch weitere Impulstalente über das Klassenmerkmal Portalverbesserung. Du kannst nur solche Impulstalente wählen, die eines deiner Kinetischen Elemente als Kategorie aufführen.</p>\n<p>Impulse sind magisch. Sie sind keine Zauber, aber Dinge, die Zauber betreffen, betreffen auch Impulse. Effekte, die dich am Zaubern hindern würden (z.B. Gestaltwandel in eine Kampfgestalt) oder gegen Zauber beschützen (z.B. ein Zauber, der vor anderen Zaubern schützt, oder der Bonus einer Kreatur auf Rettungswürfe gegen Zauber), betreffen auch Impulse.</p>\n<h3>Impulsstufen</h3>\n<p>Deine Impulse wirken auf deiner Charakterstufe. Wenn du z.B. die 5. Stufe besitzt, besäße auch dein Elementargeschoss die 5. Stufe (und Entgegenwirkengrad 3), auch wenn du es mit der 1. Stufe erhalten hast.</p>\n<p>Ähnlich wie Zauber werden auch viele Impulse mächtiger, wenn du in der Stufe aufsteigst. Diese Impulse weisen am Ende einen oder mehrere „Stufe“-Einträge auf. Hier steht entweder, mit welcher Stufe der Impuls eine Verbesserung erfährt, oder befindet sich ein Zahlenwert mit einem Pluszeichen, der angibt, dass ein Vorteil regelmäßig besser wird. Ein Impuls der 1. Stufe mit dem Eintrag „Stufe (+4)“ würde somit mit der 5., 9., 13. und 17. Stufe jeweils stärker werden.</p>\n<h3>Impulsangriffe und Impulsangriffs-SG</h3>\n<p>Ein Impuls, der einen Rettungswurf erfordert, nutzt deinen Kinetikerklassen-SG. Manche Impulse verlangen einen Impulsangriffswurf, um ihre Effektivität zu bestimmen. Dein Impulsangriffswurf nutzt denselben Kompetenzgrad und Attributsmodifikator wie dein Kinetikerklassen-SG. Wie ein Zauberangriffsmodifikator nutzt dein Impulsangriffsmodifikator die folgende Formel: W20 + Attributsmodifikator + Kompetenzbonus + weitere Boni + Mali. Dies bedeutet, dass dein Impulsangriffswurf in der Regel um 10 niedriger ist als dein Klassen-SG. Der Zustand @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Ausgelaugt} kann deinen Impulsangriffswurf und Klassen-SG senken. Du kannst einen <em>Portalstärker</em> (siehe Kompendium) erwerben, um einen Bonus auf deinen Impulsangriffsmodifikator zu erlangen.</p>\n<h3>Elementargeschoss</h3>\n<p>Der Impuls @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.6lbr0Jnv0zMB5uGb]{Elementargeschoss} ist ein einfacher Ausdruck deiner Macht und erlaubt dir, mit der reinen Materie deines Kinetischen Elements anzugreifen. Auch wenn jedes Element über eigene Stärken und Schwächen verfügt, werden alle nach denselben Grundprinzipien eingesetzt. Du kannst das Aussehen deines Elementargeschosses individualisieren und sogar bei jedem Einsatz eine andere Form wählen.</p>\n<h3>Einfache Kinese</h3>\n<p>Der Impuls @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.nTBrvt2b9wngyr0i]{Einfache Kinese} ermöglicht dir einfache Veränderungen an einem Element.</p>\n<h2>Kinetikertalente</h2>\n<p>Mit der 1. Stufe und dann jeder geraden Stufe erlangst du jeweils ein Kinetikerklassentalent.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitstalente <span style=\"float:right\">2.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 2. Stufe und dann jeder weiteren geraden Stufe erlangst du ein Fertigkeitstalent. Du musst in der assoziierten Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt oder besser besitzen, um ein Fertigkeitstalent wählen zu können.</p>\n<h2>Element extrahieren <span style=\"float:right\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Kreaturen mit einer starken Verbindung zu deinem Element könnten für dich problematisch sein - außer du nutzt ihr elementares Wesen zu deinem Vorteil. Du erlangst die Aktion @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.low5ORd87QeA9Oug]{Element extrahieren}.</p>\n<h2>Allgemeine Talente <span style=\"float:right\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und dann jeweils alle weiteren 4 Stufen erlangst du ein Allgemeines Talent.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitsverbesserungen <span style=\"float:right\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und dann jeweils alle weiteren 2 Stufen erlangst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung. Du kannst diese entweder nutzen, um in einer ungeübten Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu erhalten, oder um den Kompetenzgrad Experte in einer Fertigkeit zu erlangen, in der du bisher Geübt bist.</p>\n<p>Mit der 7. Stufe kannst du ferner Fertigkeitsverbesserungen nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad Meister in einer Fertigkeit zu erlangen, in der du bisher ein Experte bist.</p>\n<p>Mit der 15. Stufe kannst du ferner Fertigkeitsverbesserungen nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad Legende in einer Fertigkeit zu erlangen, in der du bisher ein Meister bist.</p>\n<h2>Willensstärke <span style=\"float:right\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Deine mentalen Verteidigungen werden stärker. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Willenswürfe steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Abstammungstalente <span style=\"float:right\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Neben dem Abstammungstalent, das du zu Beginn erhalten hast, erlangst du jeweils ein Abstammungstalent mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen.</p>\n<h2>Portalverbesserung <span style=\"float:right\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Du erreichst einen neuen Meilenstein auf deinem Weg zur absoluten Harmonie mit deinem Kinetischen Portal und musst entscheiden, wie du die Kräfte des Portals erweitern willst:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Erweiterte Elementare Meisterschaft:</strong> Dein Portal stimmt sich präziser auf eines deiner Elemente ein. Erlange ein Impulstalent von maximal deiner Stufe für eines deiner Kinetischen Elemente; solltest du über mehrere Elemente verfügen, kannst du alternativ einen Multielementarimpuls wählen. Du erlangst ferner eine Portalverbesserung für eines deiner Kinetischen Elemente. Solltest du kein Impulstalent wählen können - etwa weil du ein Kinetisches Element gewählt und über deine Klassentalente Impulstalente für dieses Element erworben hast -, kannst du stattdessen ein Kinetikertalent von maximal deiner Stufe wählen, dessen Voraussetzungen du erfüllst.</li>\n<li><strong>Multielementare Meisterschaft:</strong> Dein Portal erreicht eine weitere Elementarebene. Du erlangst ein weiteres Kinetisches Element deiner Wahl. Erlange zudem ein Impulstalent von maximal deiner Stufe mit derselben Elementkategorie. Du kannst hierbei kein Multielementimpulstalent wählen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Portalschübe</h3>\n<p>Wenn du eine Portalverbesserung erlangst, entwickelst du eine spezialisierte kinetische Technik. Wähle einen der Vorteile von der Tabelle für Portalschübe für eines deiner Kinetischen Elemente:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kritische Geschoss-Verbesserung:</strong> Diese tritt ein, wenn du mit einem Elementargeschoss des Kinetischen Elements einen Kritischen Erfolg erzielst.</li>\n<li><strong>Elementare Resistenz:</strong> Diese Option verleiht dir Schadensresistenz, während deine Kinetische Aura aktiv ist. Der Resistenzwert entspricht deiner Stufe und gilt gegen Schadensarten der aufgeführten Kategorien oder Schaden, der Kreaturen oder Effekten der aufgeführten Kategorien entspringt. Dies verleiht dir keine Immunität gegen Kreaturen der fraglichen Kategorie. Mit der 17. Stufe wird die Resistenz zu Immunität. Du kannst diese Resistenz und/oder Immunität freiwillig aufgeben, solltest wollen, dass ein Effekt dich betrifft.</li>\n<li><strong>Impulsschub:</strong> Kann anstelle eines der aufgeführten Schübe genutzt werden. Impulsschübe sind unter Einfaches Portal aufgeführt.</li>\n<li><strong>Auraschub:</strong> Fügt deiner Kinetischen Aura einen Effekt hinzu, wenn du Elemente fokussierst.</li>\n<li><strong>Fertigkeitsschub:</strong> Verleiht dir in der aufgeführten Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt und das aufgeführte Fertigkeitstalent. Solltest du in der Fertigkeit bereits Geübt sein, erhältst du stattdessen den Kompetenzgrad Geübt in einer Fertigkeit deiner Wahl. Wenn deine Kinetische Aura aktiv ist, erlangst du einen Zustandsbonus von +1 auf Würfe für die aufgeführte Fertigkeit; mit der 10. Stufe steigt der Bonus auf +2 und mit der 17. Stufe auf +3.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Du kannst jeden Portalschub nur einmal wählen, sofern es nicht anders vermerkt ist. Du kannst aber dieselbe Art von Schub für mehrere Elemente besitzen. Du kannst stets wählen, einen Portalschub nicht zu nutzen, auch wenn die Voraussetzungen vorliegen würden. Solltest du über mehrere Schübe verfügen, die zugleich eintreten könnten - z.B. Kinetische Auraschübe für verschiedene Elemente -, kannst du eine beliebige Anzahl davon anwenden.

You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a magus, you can draw replacement sigils with the tip of your weapon or your free hand for spells requiring material components, replacing them with somatic components instead of needing a material component pouch. At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-rank spell and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a magus, your number of spell slots and the highest rank of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 2-2: Magus Spells per Day. Because you split your focus between physical training and magical scholarship, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest rank and, if you can cast 2nd-rank spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 rank lower than your highest spell rank. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest rank of spell you can cast as a magus. For example, as a 1st-level magus, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level magus, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h3>Spellbook</h3>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of eight arcane cantrips and four 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be anything from a sturdy book with a secure latch entitled Theses on the Stratagems of Supernatural Warfare to a tattered collection of training pamphlets with your name scrawled on the cover.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any rank of spell you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures. Though you lose some lower spell slots as you increase in level, you keep the spells in your spellbook and can prepare them in your higher-rank slots as normal.</p>\n<p>If you have a spellbook from multiple sources (such as being a magus with the Wizard Dedication feat), you can use the same spellbook for all your spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The studious spells class feature gives you extra slots of this rank for specific spells.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spellstrike</h2>\n<p>You've learned the fundamental magus technique that lets you combine magical and physical attacks together. You gain the Spellstrike activity.</p>\n<h3>Spellstrike Specifics</h3>\n<p>Though the base Spellstrike rules cover most spells, various modifications apply to more complicated spells when loaded into your fist, blade, or other attack.</p>\n<p><strong>One Target</strong> The spell targets only the target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. Some feats let you affect more creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Reach</strong> The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, shocking grasp would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and ray of frost would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong> Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Defenses</strong> Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Invalid or Immune Target</strong> If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Actions</strong> Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Metamagic</strong> You typically can't use metamagic with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>\n<h2>Arcane Cascade</h2>\n<p>After you wield magic, you can enter a special stance to make your attacks more effective.</p>\n<h2>Hybrid Study</h2>\n<p>Your extensive physical training and carefully chosen magic combine to form a unique and dangerous fighting style that's more than the sum of its parts. You choose one field of hybrid study to represent your particular combination of skills. Your hybrid study gives you a special ability, usually tied to Spellstrike or Arcane Cascade, and it determines your initial conflux spell. The hybrid studies presented in this book are as follows.</p>\n<h3>Aloof Firmament</h3>\n<p>You're a philosopher of the sword who codifies your study of qinggong along principles arcane and martial. Your blade teaches morality and immortality, and you illustrate its lessons with an academician's rigor. Through your training, you've learned to move about with grace and create opportunity to strike foes.</p>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.LQw0yIMDUJJkq1nD]{Cat Fall} general feat, though you benefit from it only as long as you aren't using a shield and are wearing light or no armor.</p>\n<p>While in Arcane Cascade stance, your steps become even lighter, giving you the benefits of the Quick Jump general feat. When you Fly, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.d5I6018Mci2SWokk]{Leap}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.2HJ4yuEFY1Cast4h]{High Jump}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.JUvAvruz7yRQXfz2]{Long Jump} while in that stance, your movement doesn't trigger reactions. If you take one of these actions, the next Strike you make before the end of your turn with a one-handed weapon in the sword group has greater damage from Arcane Cascade. Increase the extra damage to 4; increase it to 6 if you have weapon specialization, or to 8 if you have greater weapon specialization. You must have your other hand completely free; the extra damage doesn't apply if you have a free-hand weapon or other item in that hand, even if you would normally be able to use the hand for other things.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell </strong>sky laughs at waves</p>\n<h3>Inexorable Iron</h3>\n<p>Once you begin along a path, nothing can stop you from reaching its end. You transform the mass of a greataxe, greatsword, or polearm into an unstoppable force to augment your own striking power or keep you standing on the battlefield. When you enter Arcane Cascade stance and at the start of each of your turns while you're in that stance, if you're wielding a melee weapon in two hands, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to half your level (minimum 1 temporary HP).</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> thunderous strike</p>\n<h3>Laughing Shadow</h3>\n<p>Magic is freeing, a means to your ends, and you can use it to go where you want, do as you please, and avoid the consequences. You are a laughing shadow of spell and blade, always one step ahead of your foes, always with a trick up your sleeve.</p>\n<p>While in Arcane Cascade stance, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds, or a +10-foot bonus if you're unarmored. If you have a free hand while in the stance and are attacking an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} creature, you increase the extra damage to 3, to 5 if you have weapon specialization, or to 7 if you have greater weapon specialization. You must have your other hand completely free; the extra damage doesn't apply if you have a free-hand weapon or other item in that hand, even if you would normally be able to use the hand for other things.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> dimensional assault</p>\n<h3>Sparkling Targe</h3>\n<p>You've studied the applications of magic, training yourself to perform not just offensive maneuvers but defensive tactics as well. When magic flows through you, your shield can block impossible things, even a dragon's breath or a magic missile.</p>\n<p>You gain the Shield Block general feat.</p>\n<p>When you're in Arcane Cascade stance with your shield raised, your circumstance bonus to AC from your shield also applies to your saves against spells and other magical effects. In addition, damage you take as a result of a spell or magical effect while you're in Arcane Cascade can trigger your Shield Block reaction, even if the damage isn't physical. When blocking damage in this way, increase your shield's Hardness by an amount equal to the extra damage from Arcane Cascade (typically 1, but 2 if you have weapon specialization, or 3 if you have greater weapon specialization). These benefits apply whether you're using an actual shield, the shield spell, or something else that works like a shield (such as a raised tome if you have the Raise a Tome feat).</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> shielding strike</p>\n<h3>Starlit Span</h3>\n<p>With magic, the sky's the limit, and you can't be bound by the confines of physical proximity. Your power reaches as far as your senses can perceive, transcending the space between you and your target even with spells that normally require direct physical contact.</p>\n<p>When you use Spellstrike, you can make a ranged weapon or ranged unarmed Strike, as long as the target is within the first range increment of your ranged weapon or ranged unarmed attack. You can deliver the spell even if its range is shorter than the range increment of your ranged attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> shooting star</p>\n<h3>Twisting Tree</h3>\n<p>The staff is perhaps one of the simplest of weapons, but this simplicity belies its elegance and versatility. To you, a staff is casting implement and martial weapon alike-the foundation of a fighting style.</p>\n<p>While you wield a staff in one hand, the staff adjusts in shape and weight, gaining the agile trait and increasing its damage die size to 1d6. While you wield a staff in both hands, it lengthens, twists, and reshapes, gaining the parry, reach, and trip traits. While you're in Arcane Cascade stance, you can Interact or Release to change your grip on the weapon as a free action when you Strike with your staff, including Strikes made in a Spellstrike. This happens before you roll your attack roll.

Your mastery of qinggong allows qi-infused fabric to tear flesh, bind blades, and pierce steel.</p>\n<p>You can create a special weapon, qi-infused fabric, by Interacting to grip a length of cloth of 1 Bulk or less and filling it with your qi. If you Interact to draw the object, you can do this as part of that action. For most unfurling brocade magi, this item is a scarf, sash, ribbon, or a similarly voluminous article of worn clothing, such as long sleeves. You can use the fabric as a bladed scarf. Unlike a normal bladed scarf, you have the option to wield the fabric in one hand instead of two. Its damage die is d4 if held in one hand. If you're wearing handwraps of mighty blows, you can apply any of its runes to the fabric, provided those runes could be added to a bladed scarf. This begins when you wield the fabric and ends when you cease doing so.</p>\n<p>While in Arcane Cascade stance, the magical energy flowing through your fabric partially animates it to accomplish an even greater range of tricks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you critically succeed at an Athletics check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Dt6B1slsBy8ipJu9]{Disarm}, you can spend a single action immediately afterward to flick your fabric, causing the disarmed object to fall to the ground in your space rather than in your opponent's.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your fabric gains the grapple trait.

You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity.

Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. To cast a heightened spell, you must have the heightened version in your repertoire; for example, you can't cast a 3rd-rank version of a spell that is only in your repertoire at 1st rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest rank of spell you can cast as an oracle. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The oracular clarity class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the divine spell list, or from other divine spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2-3), you add a spell of the same rank to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<p><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></p>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Mystery</h2>\n<p>An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle's mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity.</p>\n<p>Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your mystery grants you additional spells, and special focus spells called revelation spells. Your mystery also gives you a unique cursebound ability that lets you draw upon the divine, as well as dictating the effects of the oracular curse that falls upon you when you touch too much of this power.</p>\n<p>The following oracle mysteries are presented in this book.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.qvRlih3u7vK3FYUR]{Ancestors}: Voices of past generations teach and haunt you.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.gjOGOR30Czpnx3tM]{Battle}: You embody the virtues upheld by heroes of legend.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.IaxmCkdsPlA52spu]{Bones}: Death always seems near, and the dead speak to you.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.RI2EMRBBPNSoTJXu]{Cosmos}: You draw power from the stars and the spaces between.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.GTSvbFb36InvuH0w]{Flames}: You dance with fire and do your best to remain unscorched by it.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.o1gGG36wpn9mxeop]{Life}: The teeming energies of life flow through you out into the world.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.tZBb3Kh4nJcNoUFI]{Lore}: You gain access to unparalleled, overwhelming knowledge.</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.W9cF7wZztLDb1WGY]{Tempest}: Wind, waves, and storms rage at your beck and call.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Revelation Spells</strong></p>\n<p>The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells. Revelation spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to search for omens in a way befitting your mystery, like gazing into a fire, throwing bones and seeing how they fall, or meditating to hear the voices of those who came before you.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells.</p>\n<p>The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points.</p>\n<p>You learn a revelation spell at 1st level and start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. This spell is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. You can learn additional revelation spells through oracle feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Oracular Curse</strong></p>\n<p>As an oracle, you can tap into the pure and unmitigated divine power of creation to supplement your spellcasting via cursebound abilities. These abilities grant you special benefits, but the backlash of letting this power into your mortal body manifests as an oracular curse. The more cursebound abilities you use, the more your curse worsens, but you might gain divine benefits even as it tightens its grip on your soul.</p>\n<p>Your oracular curse is expressed using the cursebound condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles. Immediately after the first time you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1, and if you use a cursebound ability while you are already cursebound, you increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1 after the ability resolves. At lower levels, you can tolerate only a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound condition can't increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4. Once saturated in divine power, your soul can't absorb any more, and so you can't use a cursebound ability if you are already at your maximum cursebound condition.</p>\n<p>Your oracular curse lists the specific effects of being cursebound, which are cumulative as your curse progresses. You remain cursebound until you Refocus, which reduces your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a Focus Point. As your curse is a direct result of divine power, you cannot mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your curse or any ability with the cursebound trait by any means other than Refocusing. For example, if a cursebound effect makes creatures concealed from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as sure strike (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, cleanse affliction and similar abilities don't affect your curse at all.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a cursebound oracle feat determined by your mystery, and you can learn additional cursebound abilities through oracle feats.</p>\n<h2>Oracle Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an oracle class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell rank or lower). You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>The intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer over time. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Mysterious Resolve Level 7</h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Oracular Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Major Curse<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to better balance the conflicting powers wreaking havoc on your body. Immediately after completing the casting of a revelation spell while you are affected by your moderate curse, your curse progresses to its major effect, rather than overwhelming you. This effect lasts until you Refocus, which reduces your curse to its minor effect. If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of your major curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse.</p>\n<p>In addition, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool from 2 to 3. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Premonition's Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You truly understand the deep and complex divine power within your mystery. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Extreme Curse<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have mastered a perilous balance between the conflicting divine powers of your mystery, gaining the power to change your fate, but straining both body and soul. When you cast a revelation spell while affected by your major curse, your curse intensifies to an extreme effect instead of overwhelming you. All mysteries share the same effects for their extreme curse.</p>\n<p>When affected by your extreme curse, you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed 2} (or increase your doomed condition by 2 if you were already doomed). Once every 10 minutes, when you fail an attack roll, skill or Perception check, or saving throw, you can reroll it and use the second result. The reroll has the fortune trait and doesn't require you to spend an action, meaning you can use the reroll even if you can't act. These effects are in addition to all the effects of your major curse, and they can't be removed by any means until you Refocus to reduce your curse to its minor effect.</p>\n<p>If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of this extreme curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse, and you remain doomed 2 even if you Refocus.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you spend at least 3 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Greater Mysterious Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You can harness divine power at a level few others can match. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Oracular Clarity<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You now fully grasp the nature of the divine power behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to miracles. Add two common 10th-rank divine spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.PExiZZTSP4p7TZaW]{Oracular Providence} feat to gain a second slot.</p>\n<h1>Mysteries</h1>\n<p>Choose the divine mystery that fuels your mystical power. Your mystery might represent a pantheistic devotion to all the deities with power over the subject of your mystery, veneration of a particular ideal, or a conduit to raw divine energy. Whatever its origin and nature, your mystery determines the revelation spells you can cast and the oracular curse that overtakes your body. You learn skills related to that mystery, gain access to a cantrip, and gain a special benefit drawn from the combined divine knowledge and experience of your mystery.</p>\n<h2>Reading a Mystery Entry</h2>\n<p>A mystery entry contains the following information, followed by a description of that mystery's curse.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Granted Spells</strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in Spell Repertoire on page 130. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-rank spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast oracle spells of that rank.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Revelation Spells</strong> You automatically gain your mystery's initial revelation spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Revelation, Greater Revelation, and Diverse Mystery oracle feats.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Related Domains</strong> These are the cleric domains associated with your mystery. You gain domain spells, which you can cast as revelation spells, by taking the Domain Acumen and Domain Fluency feats. At 11th level, the divine access class feature also gives you additional slotted spells based on your domains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mystery Skill</strong> You become trained in the listed skill. A few mysteries make you trained in more than one skill.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Oracle Feat</strong> You gain this 1st-level oracle feat. This is a cursebound feat, so using it aggravates your oracular curse.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"

Du findest sie zu Beginn dieser Klassenbeschreibung.</p>\n<h2>Mentalistenzauberei</h2>\n<p>Du greifst auf den kräftig sprudelnden Quell der Macht zurück, welcher in deinem eigenen Verstand existiert, und wirkst Mentalmagie nur Kraft deiner Gedanken und deines Willens. Du kannst okkulte Zauber wirken. Dabei veränderst du einige der herkömmlichen Zauberkomponenten. Du nutzt keine Worte, sondern ersetzt verbale Komponenten durch eine spezielle mentale Komponente, die dein Klassenmerkmal Unterbewusster Verstand festlegt. Dies repräsentiert, wie du deinen Verstand angesichts des beabsichtigten Effektes anstrengst. All diese Komponenten versehen den von dir gewirkten Zauber mit der Kategorie Konzentration. Ebenso ersetzt du Materialkomponenten durch die Komponente Gestik (wobei du im Vergleich zur komplexen Gestik anderer Zauberwirker einfache Kopf- oder Handbewegungen machst). Deine Zauber besitzen immer noch die üblichen klaren und erkennbaren hör- und sichtbaren Manifestationen.</p>\n<p>Du kannst jeden Tag einen Zauber des 1. Grades wirken. Du musst einen Zauber kennen, um ihn wirken zu können - du erlernst deine Zauber über das Klassenmerkmal Zauberrepertoire. Die Anzahl der Zauber, die du jeden Tag wirken kannst, wird als deine Zauberplätze bezeichnet.</p>\n<p>Wenn du weitere Stufen als Mentalist erlangst, steigt die Anzahl deiner Zauber pro Tag, ebenso wie du nach und nach Zauber höherer Grade wirken kannst - siehe Tabelle 2.</p>\n<p>Manche deiner Zauber erfordern einen Zauberangriffswurf, um zu bestimmen, wie wirksam sie sind. Andere fordern von deinen Zielen Rettungswürfe gegen deinen Zauber-SG. Da dein Schlüsselattribut von deinem Unterbewussten Verstand bestimmt wird, nutzen deine Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG den Modifikator dieses Schlüsselattributs.</p>\n<h3>Erhöhte Zauber</h3>\n<p>Sobald du Zauberplätze des 2. oder höheren Grades erlangst, kannst du diese Zauberplätze mit stärkeren Versionen von Zaubern niederen Grades belegen. Du erhöhst den Grad des fraglichen Zaubers auf den Grad des genutzten Zauberplatzes. Um den Grad eines Zaubers zu erhöhen, muss er sich in deinem Zauberrepertoire zu dem fraglichen Grad befinden. Viele Zauber weisen spezifische Verbesserungen auf, wenn sie auf bestimmte Grade erhöht werden. Das Klassenmerkmal Signaturzauber lässt dich bestimmte Zauber frei erhöhen.</p>\n<h3>Zaubertricks</h3>\n<p>Einige deiner Zauber fallen in die Kategorie Zaubertrick. Ein Zaubertrick verwendet keinen Zauberplatz. Du kannst einen Zaubertrick beliebig oft am Tag wirken. Dabei wird sein Grad automatisch auf die Hälfte deiner Stufe (aufgerundet) erhöht, was dem höchsten Zaubergrad entspricht, den du als Mentalist wirken kannst. Als Mentalist der 1. Stufe wirkst du Zaubertricks auf dem 1. Grad und als Mentalist der 5. Stufe als Zauber des 3. Grades.</p>\n<p>Als Mentalist besitzt du zudem die Fähigkeit, einige deiner Zaubertricks mittels besonderer Vorteile und Mentaler Verstärkungen zu verbessern. Im Laufe deiner Karriere verleiht dir die Wahl, welche du im Rahmen des Klassenmerkmales Bewusster Verstand getroffen hast, zusätzliche Zaubertricks, Vorteile und Mentale Verstärkungen für Zaubertricks sowie eine Sammlung einzigartiger Mentaler Zaubertricks.</p>\n<h2>Zauberrepertoire</h2>\n<p>Die Sammlung der Zauber, welche du wirken kannst, wird als dein Zauberrepertoire bezeichnet. Auf der 1. Stufe lernst du einen okkulten Zauber des 1. Grades deiner Wahl und drei okkulte Zaubertricks deiner Wahl. Wähle die Zauber aus den gewöhnlichen Zaubern der okkulten Liste oder anderen Zaubern dieser Tradition, zu denen du Zugang hast. Du kannst jeden Zauber in deinem Zauberrepertoire wirken, indem du einen Zauberplatz eines passenden Zaubergrades verwendest. Deine Wahl im Rahmen des Klassenmerkmals Bewusster Verstand verleiht dir weitere Zauber für dein Repertoire, beginnend mit einem zusätzlichen Zauber des 1. Grades und zweier Zaubertricks, die unter deiner gewählten Option für Bewusster Verstand aufgeführt sind; diese Zaubertricks kannst du als Mentale Zaubertricks (siehe unten) wirken.</p>\n<p>Im Rahmen deiner Stufenaufstiege wächst dein Zauberrepertoire. Wann immer du einen Zauberplatz erlangst (siehe Tabelle 2), fügst du deinem Repertoire einen Zauber desselben Grades hinzu. Mit der 2. Stufe wählst du einen weiteren Zauber des 1. Grades, mit der 3. Stufe einen Zauber des 2. Grades usw. Wenn du Zauber hinzufügst, kannst du anstelle eines neuen Zaubers auch eine Version höheren Grades eines bereits im Repertoire befindlichen Zauber hinzufügen, sodass du eine Erhöhte Version dieses Zaubers wirken kannst. Dein Klassenmerkmal Bewusster Verstand fügt deinem Repertoire ebenfalls weitere Zauber hinzu, wenn du Zauber höherer Grade erlangst.</p>\n<p>Auch wenn du deine Zauberplätze und die Zauber in deinem Zauberrepertoire mit derselben Geschwindigkeit erlangst, werden sie dennoch getrennt behandelt. Sollte ein Talent oder andere Fähigkeit deinem Zauberrepertoire einen Zauber hinzufügen - z.B. die Zauber, die du über das Klassenmerkmal Bewusster Verstand erhältst -, so erlangst du deshalb keinen weiteren Zauberplatz oder umgekehrt.</p>\n<h3>Zauber im Repertoire austauschen</h3>\n<p>Wenn du neue Zauber für dein Repertoire erhältst, möchtest du möglicherweise einige deiner alten Zauber auswechseln. Wenn du eine Stufe erlangst und neue Zauber erlernst, kannst du einen deiner alten Zauber gegen einen anderen Zauber desselben Grades auswechseln. Dabei kann es sich auch um einen Zaubertrick handeln. Ferner kannst du im Rahmen des @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.24PSsn1SKpUwYA1X]{Umlernens} während der Auszeit Zauber auswechseln </p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Deine Stufe</th>\n<th>Zaubertricks</th>\n<th>1.</th>\n<th>2.</th>\n<th>3.</th>\n<th>4.</th>\n<th>5.</th>\n<th>6.</th>\n<th>7.</th>\n<th>8.</th>\n<th>9.</th>\n<th>10.</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;background-color:#522e2c\" colspan=\"12\">\n<p>* Dein Bewusster Verstand verleiht dir drei weitere Zaubertricks mit Verstärkungen.

Grades, der etwas anders als die anderen Zauberplätze funktioniert.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Mentale Zaubertricks und Verstärkungen</h2>\n<p>Die Magie deines Verstandes manifestiert sich als Mentale Zaubertricks, welche du mittels Fokuspunkten modifizieren kannst. Wie andere Zaubertricks kannst du auch Mentale Zaubertricks beliebig oft wirken und werden sie automatisch im Grad auf deine halbe Stufe (aufgerundet) erhöht. Du erlangst deine Mentalen Zaubertricks zusätzlich zu den okkulten Zaubertricks, die du über das Klassenmerkmal Mentalistenzauberei wählen kannst. In der Regel kannst du nur durch Talente weitere Mentale Zaubertricks erhalten. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Zaubertricks kannst du über Mentalistentalente erlangte Mentale Zaubertricks nur zu späteren Stufen auswechseln, wenn du die jeweiligen Talente umlernst.</p>\n<p>Mit der 1. Stufe erlangst du drei Mentale Zaubertricks gemäß deiner Wahl beim Klassenmerkmal Bewusster Verstand; einer ist ein einzigartiger Mentaler Zaubertrick, die beiden anderen sind gewöhnliche Zaubertricks, die in der Regel der okkulten Tradition entstammen und welche du stets als Mentale Zaubertricks wirkst. Im Rahmen deiner Mentalistenkarriere erlangst du automatisch weitere Mentale Zaubertricks.</p>\n<p>Du beginnst mit einem Fokusvorrat von 2 Fokuspunkten. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Zauberwirkern erlangst du aber keine Fokuszauber, welche du mit Fokuspunkten wirkst. Stattdessen nutzt du deine Fokuspunkte, um deine Mentalen Zaubertricks mittels Verstärkungen zu modifizieren und mit weiterer Kraft auszustatten. Verstärkungen sind spezialisierte Gedankenformen, welche den Ausdruck deiner mentalen Kraft verändern. Jeder deiner Mentalen Zaubertricks verfügt über einen Eintrag Verstärkung. Wenn du einen Mentalen Zaubertrick wirkst, kannst du 1 Fokuspunkt aufwenden, um den Verstärkungseffekt hinzuzufügen. Du kannst weitere Verstärkungen durch Talente erangen; dies erlaubt dir dann den normalen Verstärkungseffekt durch einen anderen zu ersetzen. Sofern nicht anders vermerkt, kann ein Mentaler Zaubertrick nur immer eine Verstärkung erhalten.</p>\n<p>Dein Fokusvorrat füllt sich im Rahmen deiner täglichen Vorbereitungen. Du kannst ferner Fokuspunkte zurückerlangen, indem du 10 Minuten für die Aktivität Fokus erneuern aufwendest und deinen Verstand erkundest (etwa mittels Meditation, einer Aktivität, welche dir Selbstreflektion ermöglicht, oder im Rahmen von Gesprächen über deine Gedanken und Gefühle mit dir selbst oder anderen). Hast du deine Fokuspunkte seit dem letzten Fokus erneuern nur genutzt, um Mentale Zaubertricks zu verstärken oder übersinnliche Fähigkeiten einzusetzen, so erlangst du 2 Fokuspunkte zurück (bis zu deinem Maximum von 2 Punkten). Hast du Fokuszauber für Fokuszauber oder Nichtmentalistenfähigkeiten aufgewandt (z.B. um einen über einen Archetyp erlangten Fokuszauber zu wirken), so erlangst du nur 1 Fokuspunkt zurück.</p>\n<h2>Psyche entfesseln</h2>\n<p>Indem man die Barriere zwischen seinem Verstand und der Außenwelt ausdünnt, kann man wahre übernatürliche Kraft entfesseln. Der Verstand ist aber nicht dafür gemacht, über längere Zeit auf seine volle Stärke zurückzugreifen, sodass auf die Freisetzung ein Rückschlag folgt.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.7GeguyqyD1TjoC4r]{Psyche entfesseln}</p>\n<h3>Unterbewusster Verstand</h3>\n<p>Die Kraft eines Mentalisten entspringt den Tiefen seiner Psyche fern der Oberfläche. Dein Unterbewusster Verstand könnte die Methode repräsentieren, auf die deine Macht erwacht, könnte aber auch ein Gerüst sein, das du nutzt, um sicher Zugang zum unendlichen Potential deines Verstandes zu erhalten. Dein Unterbewusster Verstand formt grundlegend, wie du auf Mentalmagie zugreifst und sie nutzt. Wähle eine der Optionen für Unterbewusster Verstand, auf die du Zugriff hast. Diese Zahl bestimmt dein Schlüsselattribut, welche besonderen Zauberkomponenten du nutzt und welche Aktion dir im Rahmen von Psyche entfesseln zur Verfügung steht. Die folgenden Optionen findest du in diesem Buch:</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.PNihL10QAB1sYSRn]{Emotionale Akzeptanz} (CH): Du greifst auf deine Kräfte zurück, indem du dich von deinen Gefühlen übermannen lässt.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.0UKDEtZ7ffTEsqCK]{Gesammeltes Wissen} (IN): Lehrer haben dir bestimmte Leitsätze und Lehren vermittelt, die dir helfen, deinen Verstand zu zügeln.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Qrhw4SILfT8YNQgB]{Präzise Disziplin} (IN): Indem du deine Gedanken säuberlich ordnest, lässt du sie Realität werden.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.EMErBnhrgUHEKAsZ]{Umherziehender Träumer} (CH): Deine Vorstellungskraft treibt deine Magie mittels Instinkt und freien Assoziationen an.</p>\n<h3>Bewusster Verstand</h3>\n<p>Egal welcher unterbewussten Quelle die Macht eines Mentalisten entspringt, erkennt jeder Mentalist, dass es ihm am einfachsten fällt, seine Magie in einer bestimmten externalen Form zu manifestieren. Dieser bewusste Ausdruck fügt deinem Zauberrepertoire mehrere weitere Zauber hinzu und verleiht dir drei Mentale Zaubertricks (zwei davon sind gewöhnliche Zauber, bei denen du jedoch noch einen besonderen Vorteil erlangst, während der dritte von deiner Wahl der Option für Bewusster Verstand ist). Mit höheren Stufen erlangst du zudem zwei weitere, für deine Wahl des Bewussten Verstandes einzigartige Mentale Zaubertricks.

Du wählst die Ausprägung deines Bewussten Verstandes mit der 1. Stufe - diese bestimmt die folgenden Elemente:</p>\n<p><strong>Verliehene Zauber</strong> Du fügst die in diesem Abschnitt aufgeführten Zauber automatisch deinem Zauberrepertoire zusätzlich zu jenen hinzu, die du durch das Klassenmerkmal Mentalistenzauberei erlangst. Mit der 1. Stufe erlangst du einen Zauber des 1. Grades; die anderen Zauber dieser Liste erhältst du, sowie du über Mentalistenzauberei den ersten Zauberplatz des fraglichen Grades erlangst - du erlangst den Zauber des 2. Grades mit der 3. Stufe, den des 3. Grades mit der 5. Stufe usw.</p>\n<p><strong>Gewöhnliche Mentale Zaubertricks</strong> Dies sind zwei Zaubertricks der Seltenheitskategorie Gewöhnlich, welche du automatisch mit der 1. Stufe erlangst. Andere Zauberwirker nutzen zwar dieselben Zaubertricks, allerdings wirkst du sie als Mentale Zaubertricks, sodass du sie zu einem höheren Effekt verstärken kannst. Deine Meisterschaft der Mentalmagie verleiht dir zudem beim Wirken dieser Zaubertricks jedes Mal einen passiven Vorteil, selbst wenn du sie nicht verstärkst. Diese Vorteile gelten nur für Zaubertricks, welche du über das Klassenmerkmal Bewusster Verstand erlangst, während du über Mentalistenzauberei erhaltene Zaubertricks normal wirkst, selbst wenn sie unter einer anderen Option für Bewusster Verstand aufgelistet sein sollten.</p>\n<p><strong>Einzigartige Mentale Zaubertricks</strong> Diese Mentalen Zaubertricks sind für die jeweilige Wahl des Bewussten Verstandes einzigartig. Du erlangst mit der 1. Stufe automatisch den Mentalen Grundlagenzaubertrick, automatisch mit der 6. Stufe den Mentalen Vertieften Zaubertrick und mit der 10. Stufe automatisch den Mentalen Mächtigen Zaubertrick.</p>\n<h2>Mentalistentalente<span style=\"float: right;\">2.</span></h2>\n<p>Du erlangst ein Mentalistentalent mit jeder geraden Stufe.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitstalente<span style=\"float: right;\">2.</span></h2>\n<p>Du erlangst ein Fertigkeitstalent mit jeder geraden Stufe; um ein Fertigkeitstalent wählen zu können, musst du in der fraglichen Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt oder besser besitzen.</p>\n<h2>Allgemeine Talente<span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Du erlangst ein Allgemeines Talent mit der 3. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen (mit der 7., 11., 15. und 19. Stufe).</p>\n<h2>Signaturzauber<span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Du erlernst, einige deiner Zauber flexibler zu wirken. Weise jedem deiner Zaubergrade einen dir verfügbaren Zauber dieses Grades als Signaturzauber zu. Du musst keine Erhöhten Versionen deiner Signaturzauber lernen, sondern kannst sie frei erhöhen. Solltest du einen Signaturzauber auf einem höheren als seinen Mindestgrad erlernen, so kannst du auch alle Versionen dieses Zaubers auf niedrigeren Graden wirken, ohne sie jeweils separat erlernen zu müssen. Solltest du einen Signaturzauber auswechseln, kannst du einen Ersatzsignaturzauber desselben Grades wählen. Du kannst zudem speziell im Rahmen von Umlernen einen Signaturzauber gegen einen anderen Zauber desselben Grades auswechseln, dies erfordert ebenso viel Zeit wie das Umlernen eines normalen Zaubers.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitsverbesserungen<span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und jeder weiteren ungeraden Stufe erhältst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung. Du kannst eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung entweder nutzen, um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu erlangen oder um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu Experte zu verbessern.</p>\n<p>Mit der 7. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Experte zu Meister zu verbessern. Und mit der 15. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Meister zu Legende zu verbessern.</p>\n<h2>Abstammungstalente<span style=\"float: right;\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Neben dem Abstammungstalent, mit dem du das Spiel beginnst, erhältst du mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen ein Abstammungstalent.</p>\n<h2>Attributsverbesserungen<span style=\"float: right;\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 5 Stufen verbesserst du vier unterschiedliche Attributswerte. Du kannst auf diese Weise Attributswerte über 18 erhöhen. Sollte ein Attributswert unter 18 liegen, wird er mit einer Attributsverbesserung um 2 erhöht, andernfalls um 1.</p>\n<h2>Fokussierte Klarheit<span style=\"float: right;\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Deine tiefergehende Verbindung zu deinem Verstand verleiht dir weitere Kraft für deine Mentalen Verstärkungen. Erhöhe die Anzahl der Fokuspunkte in deinem Fokusvorrat um 1. Diese Fähigkeit ändert nicht die Anzahl an Fokuspunkten, die du durch Fokus erneuern zurückerlangst. Wie üblich kann diese Fähigkeit das Fassungsvermögen deines Fokusvorrats nicht über 3 Punkte erhöhen</p>\n<h2>Präkognitive Reflexe<span style=\"float: right;\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Eine leichte Vorahnung sorgt dafür, dass du auf Bedrohungen reagierst, ehe sie eintreten. Dein Kompetenzrang für Reflexwürfe steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Zauberexperte<span style=\"float: right;\">7.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Kompetenzgrad für okkulte Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Große Zähigkeit<span style=\"float: right;\">9.</span></h2>\n<p>Du bist körperlich sehr abgehärtet. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zähigkeitswürfe steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Außersinnliche Wahrnehmung<span style=\"float: right;\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Eine schwache seherische Gabe lässt dich wissen, wenn Gefahren nahe sind. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Wahrnehmung steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Mauern des Willens<span style=\"float: right;\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein trainierter Verstand widersteht äußeren Einflüssen. Dein Kompetenzrang für Willenswürfe steigt auf Meister. Deine erfolgreichen Willenswürfe zählen stets als Kritische Erfolge.</p>\n<h2>Waffenexpertise<span style=\"float: right;\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Übung und Magie verbessern deine Kampftechnik. Dein Kompetenzrang im Umgang mit Einfachen Waffen und Waffenlosen Angriffen verbessert sich jeweils zu Experte.</p>\n<h2>Persönliche Barriere<span style=\"float: right;\">13.</span></h2>\n<p>Subtile telekinetische Felder dämpfen auftreffende Schläge und wehren sie ab. Dein Kompetenzrang in Ungerüsteter Verteidigung steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Waffenspezialisierung<span style=\"float: right;\">13.</span></h2>\n<p>Wenn du eine Waffe berührst, hast du kurze Visionen von jenen, die sie erschaffen und geführt haben. Dies lehrt dich, wie du mit der Waffe größere Verletzungen zufügen kannst. Du verursachst 2 Punkte zusätzlichen Schaden mit jenen Waffen und Waffenlosen Angriffen, bei denen du den Kompetenzgrad Experte besitzt. Mit dem Kompetenzgrad Meister steigt dieser Zusatzschaden auf 3 und mit dem Kompetenzgrad Legende auf 4.</p>\n<h2>Zaubermeister<span style=\"float: right;\">15.</span></h2>\n<p>Du hast das Okkulte gemeistert. Dein Kompetenzgrad für okkulte Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG steigt auf Meister.</p>\n<h2>Festung des Willens<span style=\"float: right;\">17.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein trainierter Verstand ist eine uneinnehmbare Festung. Dein Kompetenzrang für Willenswürfe steigt auf Legende. Ergibt dein Willenswurf einen Kritischen Fehlschlag, so zählt er als normaler Fehlschlag. Misslingt dir ein Willenswurf gegen einen Schadenseffekt, erleidest du nur halben Schaden.</p>\n<h2>Unendlicher Verstand<span style=\"float: right;\">19.</span></h2>\n<p>Alles, was du dir vorstellen kannst, liegt nun im Rahmen der Möglichkeiten. Füge deinem Repertoire zwei gewöhnliche okkulte Zauber des 10. Grades hinzu. Du erlangst zudem einen Zauberplatz des 10. Grades, mit dem du einen dieser Zauber im Rahmen deiner Mentalistenzauberei wirken kannst. Du erlangst im Rahmen deiner Stufenaufstiege keine weiteren Zauberplätze des 10. Grades. Du kannst Zauberplätze des 10. Grades nicht mit Fähigkeiten nutzen, die dir weitere Zauberplätze verleihen oder dich Zauber wirken lassen, ohne Zauberplätze aufzuwenden. Du kannst einen zweiten Zauberplatz durch Wahl des Mentalistentalents Geist über Materie erlangen.</p>\n<h2>Zauberlegende<span style=\"float: right;\">19.</span></h2>\n<p>Du erreichst den Zenit deiner Zauberkunst und verstehst nicht nur deinen eigenen Verstand, sondern auch das kollektive Unterbewusstsein, dem alle übersinnliche Macht entspringt. Dein Kompetenzgrad für okkulte Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG steigt auf Legende.</p>"

You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p>\n<p>Each time you get a spell slot (see the Sorcerer Spells per Day table above), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. When you gain a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the sorcerous gift spell for that rank that's listed in your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot or vice versa.</p>\n<h3>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Bloodline Spells</h2>\n<p>Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells unique to your lineage. Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here.</p>\n<h2>Sorcerous Potency</h2>\n<p>Because of the magical power inherent in your blood, your spells that hurt or cure are stronger than those of other spellcasters. When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots that either deals damage or restores Hit Points, you gain a status bonus to that spell's damage or healing equal to the spell's rank. This applies only to the initial damage or healing the spell deals when cast. An individual creature takes this damage or benefits from this healing only once per spell, even if the spell would damage or heal that creature multiple times.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats Level 2</h2>\n<p>Level 2</p>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Sorcerer Feats Level 2</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a sorcerer class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your innate power allows you to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Reflex Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Perception Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Defensive Robes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to inflict grave wounds with your most practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Majestic Will<br /><span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your mind and will are tempered by your mastery of magical forces. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Bloodline Paragon<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, and they can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.6SEDoht4dXEJE5SW]{Bloodline Perfection} sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to legendary.</p>\n<h1>Bloodlines</h1>\n<p>Your bloodline determines your spell list, the tradition of spells you cast, and grants you access to two trained skills.</p>\n<h2>Bloodline Spells</h2>\n<p>Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells unique to your lineage. Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots; you can't cast them using spell slots. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points.</p>\n<p>You learn the initial bloodline spell, which is unique to your bloodline.</p>\n<h2>Reading a Bloodline Entry</h2>\n<p>A bloodline entry contains the following information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tradition</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list; <strong>Bloodline</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong> You become trained in the listed skills.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sorcerous Gifts</strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-rank spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that rank.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Spells</strong> You automatically gain the initial bloodline spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Bloodline and Greater Bloodline feats.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Blood Magic</strong> Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using a Focus Point or a sorcerous gift spell using a spell slot, you choose one blood magic effect you know to benefit from. You begin play with the benefit listed in your bloodline and can gain others through sorcerer feats.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the blood magic effect offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references to spell rank refer to the rank of the spell you cast.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"

Stufe verleiht, erhältst du die Vorteile deiner gewählten Abstammung und deines Hintergrunds.</p>\n<h2>Anfangskompetenzgrade</h2>\n<p>Mit der 1. Stufe erlangst du eine Reihe von Kompetenzgraden, die deine Grundausbildung repräsentieren. Du findest sie am Beginn dieser Klassenbeschreibung.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon</h2>\n<p>Du hast eine besondere Verbindung zu einem mächtigen und in der Regel außerweltlichen Wesen - einem Eidolon - und kannst deine Lebenskraft als die Verbindung nutzen, durch die du dieses vergängliche Wesen in der Welt der Sterblichen manifestierst. Über diese Verbindung fließt auch Magie von deinem Eidolon in dich und so bestimmt dein Eidolon die Art der Zauber, die du wirken kannst, und die Zauberliste, von der du wählst (siehe auch Beschwörerzauberei auf Seite 38).</p>\n<p>Wähle eine Art von Eidolon aus den auf Seite 42 beginnenden Optionen oder anderen Eidola, zu denen du Zugang hast. Wenn du dein Eidolon wählst, legst du auch sein Aussehen und seine allgemeine Gestalt innerhalb der Parameter für diese bestimmte Eidolonart fest. Die Art und das allgemeine Aussehen können nicht mehr geändert werden, außer du wählst besondere Evolutionstalente, welche dein Eidolon neue Eigenschaften entwickeln lassen.</p>\n<p>Die magische Verbindung mit deinem Eidolon manifestiert sich in Form eines Siegels auf euren beiden Körpern. Solange dein Eidolon manifestiert ist, glüht das Siegel und leuchtet und kann auf keine Weise bedeckt, versteckt oder getarnt werden - es strahlt durch Kleidung, erscheint über einem Umhang und bleibt auch von verhüllender Magie unbetroffen. Kombiniert mit dem Umstand, dass ihr beide klar gemeinschaftlich handelt, kann ein intelligenter Beobachter problemlos folgern, dass ihr auf irgendeine Weise verbunden seid, selbst wenn die Person noch nie einem Beschwörer begegnet sein mag.</p>\n<p>Du nutzt die Handlung Eidolon manifestieren, um dein Eidolon erscheinen zu lassen.</p>\n<p>Dein Eidolon ist kein einfacher Scherge. Es hat keine der Kategorien Herbeigezaubert oder Scherge und ihr beiden könnt zusammenarbeiten und eure Handlungen koordinieren. Ihr teilt euch die Anzahl eurer Aktionen und euren Malus für Mehrfachangriffe. Du kannst jede Runde deine Aktionen (Reaktionen und Freie Aktionen eingeschlossen) für dich oder dein Eidolon aufwenden.</p>\n<p>Du koordinierst deine Handlungen mit deinem Eidolon effizienter, wenn du Gemeinsames Handeln nutzt. Die Verbindung zu deinem Eidolon gestattet dir, zu jeder Zeit mit ihm telepathisch zu kommunizieren, selbst wenn es nicht manifestiert ist. Du erlangst zudem die Aktion Sinne teilen.</p>\n<p>Die Verbindung zwischen dir und deinem Eidolon bedeutet zuletzt auch, dass ihr euch einen gemeinsamen Vorrat an Trefferpunkten teilt. Erleidet einer von euch Schadenspunkte, so reduziert dies deine Trefferpunkte. Wird einer von euch geheilt, erhältst du Trefferpunkte zurück. Wie im Fall eurer Aktionen gilt hier ebenfalls: Unterliegen du und dein Eidolon demselben Effekt, der eure Trefferpunkte betrifft, so kommt dieser Effekt nur einmal zur Anwendung (sollte einer der Effekte stärker ausfallen, so wirkt dieser). Befinden sich beispielsweise dein Eidolon und du im Wirkungsbereich einer heilenden oder schädigenden Aura und wärt ihr beide betroffen, so kommt nur der höhere Betrag an Heilung oder Schaden zur Anwendung.\n<h3>Dein Eidolon und Ausrüstung</h3>\n<p>Dein Eidolon kann keine magischen Gegenstände tragen oder benutzen, sofern diese nicht über die Kategorie Eidolon verfügen. Ein Eidolon kann zu maximal zwei Gegenständen Resonanz aufbauen. Die Verbindung deines Eidolons zu dir bedeutet, dass es von bestimmten magischen Gegenständen profitieren kannst, zu denen du Resonanz aufgebaut hast.\n<ul>\n<li>Dein Eidolon erlangt Gegenstandsboni auf Wahrnehmungs- und Fertigkeitswürfe durch magische Gegenstände, zu denen du Resonanz aufgebaut hast.</li>\n<li>Dein Eidolon erhöht seinen Gegenstandsbonus auf seine RK entsprechend deiner Rüstungsverbesserungsrune oder deiner Rüstungsarmschienen. Es erhält weiterhin einen Gegenstandsbonus auf seine Rettungswürfe entsprechend der Widerstandsrune deiner Rüstung oder deiner Rüstungsarmschienen. Andere permanente Gegenstände, die dir Gegenstandsboni auf RK oder Rettungswürfe verleihen oder diese erhöhen, könnten nach Maßgabe des SL ähnliche Vorteile gewähren.</li>\n<li>Die Angriffe deines Eidolons profitieren von den Fundamental- und Waffeneigenschaftsrunen auf deinen Schlaghandwickeln. Alternativ kannst du zu einer magischen Waffe Resonanz aufbauen (als Ausnahme zu der Regel, dass magische Waffe keine Resonanz erlangen können), um die Fundamental- und Waffeneigenschaftsrunen dieser Waffe mit deinem Eidolon zu teilen. Du teilst diese Vorteile nur, während du die Waffe in der Hand hältst, und kannst maximal zu einer Waffe auf diese Weise Resonanz aufbauen. Das Eidolon erlangt stets nur die Vorteile, die es auch auf seine Angriffe anwenden kann, dabei gelten dieselben Einschränkungen, die unter Schlaghandwickeln aufgeführt sind.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Verlorene und modifizierte Aktionen</h3>\n<p>Erhalten du oder dein Eidolon den Zustand Beschleunigt, Betäubt oder Verlangsamt oder ist einer von euch von etwas betroffen, das die Anzahl der Aktionen modifiziert, welche du zu Beginn jedes Zuges erlangst, so wirkt sich dies auf euren gemeinsamen Aktionsvorrat aus. Solltet ihr beide einem solchen Effekt unterliegen, so wende nur den schwerwiegenderen an. Beispiel: Unterliegst du oder dein Eidolon dem Zustand Verlangsamt 1, so würdest du deinen Zug mit einer Aktion weniger beginnen; unterliegt ihr beide dem Zustand Verlangsamt 1, würde dich dies immer noch nur 1 Aktion kosten statt 2 Aktionen. Solltest du aber den Zustand Verlangsamt 1 haben und dein Eidolon den Zustand Verlangsamt 2, so hättest du zwei Aktionen weniger, da dies der schwerwiegendere Effekt ist. Sollte nur einer von euch darin eingeschränkt werden, wie er seine Aktionen nutzen kann, so gilt dies nicht automatisch für den anderen. Beispiel: Erhält dein Eidolon den Zustand Bewegungsunfähig oder Versteinert, könnte es sich nicht bewegen, dies würde aber nicht auch für dich gelten und du könntest deine Aktionen immer noch nutzen, um dich zu bewegen. In unklaren Situationen hat der SL das letzte Wort.</p>\n<p>Als Spieler lenkst du deinen Beschwörer und das Eidolon; im Normalfall kooperieren die beiden, solange du nicht entscheidest, dass dies nicht der Fall sein soll. Die Verbindung des Beschwörers zum Eidolon ist zwar eine Partnerschaft, doch letztendlich ist das Eidolon an dich gebunden, nicht andersherum. Sollte es jemals zu einem Konflikt kommen, wer handeln darf, so hast du stets Vorrang vor deinem Eidolon. Dies bedeutet beispielsweise im Fall, wenn die Handlungen des Eidolons nicht von dir bestimmt werden, weil es vielleicht den Zustand Gesteuert oder Verwirrt besitzt, dass du den gesamten gemeinsamen Aktionenvorrat nutzen kannst. In diesem Fall hätte das Eidolon dann keine Aktionen übrig, um Ärger zu machen, jedenfalls, solange du selbst handlungsfähig bist. Solltest du dagegen selbst unter einen solchen Effekt gelangen, würdest du den ganzen gemeinsamen Aktionsvorrat verbrauchen und so dein Eidolon am Handeln hindern.</p>\n<h2>Beschwörerzauberei</h2>\n<p>Die Verbindung zu deinem Eidolon verleiht dir begrenzte magische Kräfte, die mit dem Wesen deines Eidolons verbunden sind. Du kannst mittels der Aktivität Zauber wirken Zauber nutzen und dabei Material-, Gesten und Verbale Komponenten einbringen. Da du deine Magie aus deinem Eidolon beziehst, kannst du normalerweise Materialkomponenten durch Gestik ersetzen und benötigst deshalb keinen Materialkomponentenbeutel. Du kannst jeden Tag einen Zauber des 1. Grades und fünf Zaubertricks wirken. Um Zauber wirken zu können, musst du sie kennen - du lernst Zauber über das Klassenmerkmal Zauberrepertoire. Die Anzahl an Zaubern, die du jeden Tag wirken kannst, wird als deine Zauberplätze bezeichnet.</p>\n<p>Wenn deine Beschwörerstufe steigt, verleiht dir die magische Verbindung zu deinem Eidolon weitere, mächtigere Zauberplätze. Über wie viele Zauberplätze du verfügst und auf welchem Zaubergrad du maximal Zauber wirken kannst, entnimmst du Tabelle 2-2: Beschwörerzauber pro Tag. Aufgrund der Art, wie du Magie über die Verbindung zu deinem Eidolon beziehst, verlierst du ab der 5. Stufe, Zauberplätze niedrigerer Grade. Über deine Klasse als Beschwörer kannst du maximal vier Zauberplätze erlangen; dieses Maximum erreichst du mit der 4. Stufe.</p>\n<p>Manche deiner Zauber erfordern, dass du einen Zauberangriffswurf durchführst, um zu bestimmen, wie erfolgreich der Zauber ist, oder erforder, dass deine Gegner einen Wurf gegen deinen Zauber-SG durchführen (meist einen Rettungswurf). Da dein Schlüsselattribut Charisma ist, verwendest du für deinen Zauberangriffswurf und deinen Zauber-SG jeweils deinen Charismamodifikator. Details zur Berechnung dieser Spielwerte findest du auf Seite 447 des Grundregelwerkes.</p>\n<h3>Erhöhte Zauber</h3>\n<p>Sobald du Zauberplätze des 2. oder höheren Grades erlangst, kannst du diese Zauberplätze mit stärkeren Versionen von Zaubern niederen Grades belegen. Du erhöhst den Grad des fraglichen Zaubers auf den Grad des genutzten Zauberplatzes. Viele Zauber weisen spezifische Verbesserungen auf, wenn sie auf bestimmte Grade erhöht werden.</p>\n<h3>Zaubertricks</h3>\n<p>Einige deiner Zauber fallen in die Kategorie Zaubertrick. Ein Zaubertrick verwendet keinen Zauberplatz. Du kannst einen Zaubertrick beliebig oft am Tag wirken. Dabei wird sein Grad automatisch auf die Hälfte deiner Stufe (aufgerundet) erhöht, was dem höchsten Zaubergrad entspricht, den du als Beschwörer wirken kannst. Als Beschwörer der 1. Stufe wirkst du Zaubertricks auf dem 1. Grad und als Beschwörer der 5. Stufe als Zauber des 3. Grades.</p>\n<h2>Zauberrepertoire</h2>\n<p>Die Sammlung der Zauber, welche du wirken kannst, wird als dein Zauberrepertoire bezeichnet. Auf der 1. Stufe lernst du zwei Zauber des 1. Grades deiner Wahl und fünf Zaubertricks deiner Wahl. Die Tradition bestimmt sich aus der Art deines Eidolons. Wähle die Zauber aus den gewöhnlichen Zaubern der fraglichen Liste oder anderen Zaubern dieser Tradition, zu denen du Zugang hast. Du kannst jeden Zauber in deinem Zauberrepertoire wirken, indem du einen Zauberplatz eines passenden Zaubergrades verwendest. Deine Zauberplätze und die Zauber in deinem Zauberrepertoire sind voneinander unabhängig. Sollte ein Talent oder andere Fähigkeit deinem Zauberrepertoire einen Zauber hinzufügen, so verleiht dir dies keinen weiteren Zauberplatz; umgekehrt gilt dasselbe.</p>\n<p>Wenn du weitere Stufen erlangst, fügst du neue Zauber deinem Zauberrepertoire hinzu. Wenn du dabei einen Zauberplatz erlangst (siehe Tabelle 2-2: Beschwörerzauber pro Tag), fügst du deinem Zauberrepertoire einen Zauber desselben Grades hinzu. Mit der 2. Stufe wählst du einen weiteren Zauber des 1. Grades; mit der 3. Stufe wählst du deinen ersten Zauber des 2. Grades und mit der 4. Stufe den zweiten. Zugleich erreicht dein Zauberrepertoire mit der 4. Stufe sein Maximum von vier Zaubern.</p>\n<p>Mit der der 5. Stufe fügst du deinem Zauberrepertoire zwei Zauber des 3. Grades hinzu, verlierst zugleich aber deinen niedrigsten Grad an Zauberplätzen. Wenn du die Zauberplätze eines Grades verlierst, verlierst du zugleich zwei Zauber deines Repertoires. Dabei kann es sich um dir bekannte Zauber handeln oder auch um jene Zauber, die du eigentlich mit der neuen Stufe erlangen würdest. Bei Erreichen von Stufen, auf denen sich deine Zauberplätze nicht auf diese Weise verändern, kannst du mehrere Zauber austauschen, wie im Folgenden beschrieben.</p>\n<h3>Zauber im Repertoire austauschen</h3>\n<p>Wenn du neue Zauber für dein Repertoire erhältst, möchtest du möglicherweise einige deiner alten Zauber auswechseln. Wenn du eine Stufe erlangst und neue Zauber erlernst, kannst du einen deiner alten Zauber gegen einen anderen Zauber desselben Grades auswechseln. Sollte es sich um eine Stufe handeln, mit welcher du Zauberplätze eines niedrigeren Grades verlierst, kannst du die zugleich verlorenen Zauber in beliebiger Reihenfolge ersetzen. Alternativ kannst du auch einen Zaubertrick austauschen. Ferner kannst du im Rahmen des Umlernens während der Auszeit Zauber auswechseln (GRW, Seite 481).</p>\n<p>Mit der 6. Stufe und dann mit jeder weiteren geraden Stufe kannst du eine beliebige Anzahl deiner Zauber gegen andere Zauber eines dir möglichen Zaubergrades auswechseln. Du musst aber stets über wenigstens einen Zauber verfügen, den du mit den Zauberplätzen deines niedrigsten Zaubergrades wirken könntest, damit du keine nutzlosen Zauberplätze hast. Beispiel: Mit der 6. Stufe müsstest du wenigstens einen Zauber des 2. Grades behalten, während alle anderen Zauber solche des 3. Grades sein könnten.</p>\n<h3>Beschwörerzauber pro Tag</h3>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Deine Stufe</th>\n<th>Zaubertricks</th>\n<th>1.</th>\n<th>2.</th>\n<th>3.</th>\n<th>4.</th>\n<th>5.</th>\n<th>6.</th>\n<th>7.</th>\n<th>8.</th>\n<th>9.</th>\n<th>10.</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Verbindungszauber</h2>\n<p>Deine Verbindung zu deinem Eidolon ermöglicht dir das Wirken von Verbindungszaubern. Diese speziellen Zauber sind eine Unterkategorie der Fokuszauber. Das Wirken eines Fokuszaubers kostet einen Fokuspunkt; du beginnst mit einem Fokusvorrat von 1 Fokuspunkt.</p>\n<p>Du füllst deinen Fokusvorrat während deiner täglichen Vorbereitungen auf, ferner kannst du 1 Fokuspunkt zurückerlangen, indem du 10 Minuten für die Aktivität Fokus erneuern aufwendest, um die Verbindung zu deinem Eidolon zu stärken, etwa indem ihr eine Unterhaltung unter vier Augen habt, zusammen spielt oder gemeinsam über das Wesen eurer Verbindung meditiert.</p>\n<p>Fokuszauber werden wie Zaubertricks automatisch auf einen Grad erhöht, der deiner halben Stufe (aufgerundet) entspricht. Fokuszauber benötigen keine Zauberplätze und können nicht mittels Zauberplätzen gewirkt werden. Manche Talente können dir weitere Fokuszauber verschaffen und die Größe deines Fokusvorrates vergrößern - allerdings kann dein Fokusvorrat niemals mehr als 3 Fokuspunkte enthalten. Die vollständigen Regeln zu Fokuszaubern findest du im Grundregelwerk auf Seite 300.</p>\n<p>Du erlernst den Verbindungszauber Evolutionsschub (Seite 144), der dir gestattet, deinem Eidolon einen von mehreren nützlichen Vorteilen zu verleihen.</p>\n<h3>Verbindungszaubertricks</h3>\n<p>Verbindungszaubertricks sind besondere Verbindungszauber, die keine Fokuspunkte kosten - du kannst sie daher beliebig oft wirken. Verbindungszaubertricks stehen dir neben den Zaubertricks zur Verfügung, die du von der Zauberliste deiner Tradition wählen kannst. Im Allgemeinen kannst du neue Verbindungszaubertricks nur durch Talente erlangen. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Zaubertricks kannst du über Beschwörertalente erlangte Verbindungszaubertricks nicht auf späteren Stufen auswechseln, außer du tauschst das fragliche Talent mittels Umlernen aus (siehe Grundregelwerk, Seite 481).</p>\n<p>Du erlernst den Verbindungszaubertrick Eidolon stärken, mit dem du kurzfristig die Fähigkeiten deines Eidolons verbessern kannst, so dass es mit größerer Kraft angreifen kann.</p>\n<h2>Evolutionstalent</h2>\n<p>Evolutionstalente sind eine Unterart der Beschwörertalente. Sie ermöglichen dir, dein Eidolon über eure gemeinsame Verbindung zu individualisieren. Du erlangst mit der 1. Stufe ein Evolutionstalent für dein Eidolon, welches die Unterschiede zwischen ihm und anderen Eidola seiner Art repräsentiert. Solltest du dieses Talent umlernen, so kannst du es nur durch ein anderes Evolutionstalent ersetzen.</p>\n<h2>Beschwörertalent<span style=\"float: right;\">2.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 2. Stufe und danach mit jeder geraden Stufe erhältst du ein Beschwörertalent.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitstalent<span style=\"float: right;\">2.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 2. Stufe und jeder weiteren geraden Stufe erlangst du ein Fertigkeitstalent. Um ein Fertigkeitstalent wählen zu können, musst du wenigstens den Kompetenzgrad Ge- übt in der assoziierten Fertigkeit besitzen.</p>\n<h2>Allgemeine Talente<span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen erlangst du ein Allgemeines Talent.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitsverbesserung<span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und jeder weiteren ungeraden Stufe erhältst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung. Du kannst eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung entweder nutzen, um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu erlangen oder um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu Experte zu verbessern.</p>\n<p>Mit der 7. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Experte zu Meister zu verbessern und mit der 15. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Meister zu Legende zu verbessern.</p>\n<h2>Gemeinsame Wachsamkeit<span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Eidolon und du bleiben gemeinsam wachsam gegen- über Gefahren, so dass ihr weitaus mehr wahrnehmen könnt, als dir allein möglich wäre.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Panache</h2>\n<p>You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular style, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This heightened state of flair is called panache.</p>\n<p>You gain panache by performing actions that have the bravado trait. @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.21WIfSu7Xd7uKqV8]{Tumble Through} and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style (see below) gain the bravado trait when you use them. The GM might determine that a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, can gain the bravado trait. These checks typically involve at least a single action and a non-trivial DC. Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.</p>\n<p>Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher, can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache.</p>\n<h2>Precise Strike</h2>\n<p>When you make a Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the Strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.</p>\n<p>As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. At 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike by 1 and the additional damage on a finisher by 1d6.</p>\n<h2>Stylish Combatant</h2>\n<p>You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with the bravado trait while in a combat encounter. While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds.</p>\n<h2>Swashbuckler's Style</h2>\n<p>Your own distinctive style lets you gracefully handle any situation. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.5HoEwzLDJGTCZtFa]{Battledancer}</strong> To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you command your foes' attention with mesmerizing motions.

You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Stylish Tricks<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you gain an additional skill increase you can apply only to Acrobatics or the skill from your swashbuckler's style.

Increase the status bonus to your Speeds from stylish combatant to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus increases by 5 feet at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don't have panache, you still get half this status bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Attribute Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons.

Stufe verleiht, erhältst du die Vorteile deiner gewählten Abstammung und deines Hintergrundes beschrieben.</p>\n<h2>Anfangskompetenzgrade</h2>\n<p>Mit der 1. Stufe erlangst du eine Reihe von Kompetenzgraden, die deine Grundausbildung repräsentieren. Du findest sie am Beginn dieser Klassenbeschreibung.</p>\n<h2>Esoterisches Wissen</h2>\n<p>Deine Erfahrungen mit dem Unbekannten und die Dinge, die du von anderen Thaumaturgen erfahren hast, umfassen alle möglichen seltsamen Phänomene. Du erlangst den Kompetenzgrad Geübt in Kenntnis (Esoterik) und kannst diese besondere Kenntnisfertigkeit zu Wissen abrufen nutzen bezüglich Flüchen, Spukerscheinungen und Kreaturen jeder Kategorie, aber nicht bezüglich anderer Themen. Im Gegensatz zu gewöhnlichen Kenntnisfertigkeiten nutzt du als Bezugsattribut Charisma und damit deinen Charismamodifikator bei Würfen für Kenntnis (Esoterik).</p>\n<p>Du erlangst ferner das Fertigkeitstalent @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.1Bt7uCW2WI4sM84P]{Gefährliches Halbwissen}.</p>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe steigt dein Kompetenzgrad in Kenntnis (Esoterik) auf Experte, mit der 7. Stufe auf Meister und mit der 15. Stufe auf Legende.</p>\n<h2>Erstes Paraphernum und Esoterica</h2>\n<p>Dein Paraphernum ist ein besonderer Gegenstand von symbolischer Bedeutung; es ist dein Schild und dein Erkennungszeichen, wenn du dich mit dem Übernatürlichen befasst, und ein machtvolles Werkzeug, sollte Gewalt auf der Tagesordnung stehen. Wähle ein Paraphernum aus den Optionen @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.PoclGJ7BCEyIuqJe]{Amulett}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.MyN1cQgE0HsLF20e]{Buch}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.DK1LCE5pd0YCY11c]{Glocke}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.DhdLzrcMvB93Rjmt]{Insignie}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.1vgFGSnn0DIBmK7j]{Kelch}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.AltwHU7hCqTwpn48]{Laterne}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.N6KvTbaRsphc0Ymb]{Spiegel}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.pDxdE8S8QJV2PGiB]{Stab} oder @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.YiDkrwaxiF7Gao7y]{Waffe}. Du beginnst das Spiel mit einem nichtmagischen Gegenstand der fraglichen Art und erhältst den Ausgangsvorteil für dieses Paraphernum. Auch wenn ein Paraphernum dir nützlich ist, besitzt es in der Regel keinen Verkaufswerk. Solltest du einen neuen Gegenstand derselben Paraphernumkategorie erlangen, kannst du 1 Tag an Auszeit aufwenden, um dich auf den neuen Gegenstand einzustimmen und ihn fortan als dein Paraphernum zu behandeln. Im Rahmen deiner Thaumaturgenprogression wirst du bis zu drei Paraphernalien sammeln und ihr verborgenes Potential erschließen, sodass du ihre Vorteile nutzen kannst, ganz wie es die jeweilige Lage erfordert.</p>\n<p>Deine Paraphernalien sind zwar im Hinblick auf das Übernatürliche deine Hauptwerkzeuge, allerdings weißt du, wie wichtig es ist, stets vorbereitet zu sein. Du sammelst daher unaufhörlich diverse kleinere mystische Gegenstände, Materialien mit paranormalen Affinitäten und Dinge, die bei den im Volk verbreiteten Praktiken genutzt werden, und führst diese Esoterica mit dir. Dabei könnte es sich u.a. um kaltgeschmiedete Eisennägel, Fetzen von Schriftrollen und heiligen Texten, Knochensplitter angeblicher Heiliger und ähnliches handeln. Du verwahrst deine Esoterica an leicht zugänglichen Plätzen an deiner Person und bist gut geübt darin, sie zusammen mit deinem Paraphernum einzusetzen - daher kannst du Esoterica mit derselben Hand hervorholen und einsetzen, mit der du ein Paraphernum führst.</p>\n<h3>Schwachstellen ausnutzen</h3>\n<p>Du weißt, dass jede Kreatur, egal wie obskur, über eine Schwachstelle verfügt. Indem du den richtigen Gegenstand erkennst und auflädst, kannst du selbst die widerstandsfähigsten Monster niederstrecken. Du erlangst die Aktion @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.fodJ3zuwQsYnBbtk]{Schwachstellen ausnutzen}.</p>\n<p>Du kannst Schwachstellen ausnutzen auf eine von zwei Weisen versuchen einzusetzen: Du kannst Eigenschaften nutzen, welche Kreaturen der fraglichen Art zurücktreiben, oder versuchen zu improvisieren und mit deinen Esoterica eine ganz persönliche Schwäche einer Kreatur zu finden, die in der Regel aber nicht so schwerwiegend wie eine bestehende Schwäche der Kreatur ist.</p>\n<p><strong>Persönliche Antithese</strong> Du improvisierst und lädst ein Stück deiner Esoterica-Sammlung auf, welches du sodann präsentierst und eine Kreatur auf persönlicher Ebene anekeln soll; gegenüber einem Tyrannen könntest du z.B. ein Stück einer zerbrochenen Kette nutzen, die einst einen Gefangenen oder einen Sklaven gebunden hat. Dies verursacht bei der Zielkreatur (und nur bei dieser) eine Schwäche gegen deine Waffenlosen und Waffenangriffe in Höhe deiner halben Stufe +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Tödliche Schwachstelle</strong> Nachdem du die Schwäche einer Kreatur identifiziert hast, nutzt du ein thematisch passendes Stück deiner Sammlung, um deine Angriffe auf diese Schwäche einzustimmen. Deine Waffenlosen und Waffenangriffe sprechen die höchste Schwäche an, die du mittels Schwachstellen ausnutzen erkannt hast, wobei sich die Schadensart deiner Waffe nicht verändert. Dieser Schaden betrifft das Ziel deiner Aktion Schwachstellen ausnutzen und jede andere Kreatur der genau identischen Kategorie, aber nicht Kreaturen, welche nur über dieselbe Schwäche verfügen. Wenn du z.B. gegen ein Rudel Werwölfe kämpfst, könntest du Silbersplitter oder zerstoßenen Mondstein einsetzen, damit dein Schaden die Schwäche der Werwölfe gegenüber Silber anspricht, allerdings würde dies nicht zugleich andere Kreaturen mit einer Schwäche gegen Silber betreffen.</p>\n<h2>Macht des Paraphernums</h2>\n<p>Die Kraft deines Paraphernums kann auch im Kampf genutzt werden, indem sie die Effekte von Runen und anderen magischen Verzauberungen stärkt. Bei Angriffen kannst du mit einem gehaltenen Paraphernum mystische Muster zeichnen, um den Angriff zu stärken; dieser verursacht dann pro Waffenschadenswürfel zusätzlich 2 Schadenspunkte. Hierzu musst du all deine Hände einsetzen. Du erlangst den Vorteil deines Paraphernums nicht, solltest du in deinen Händen etwas anderes halten als eine Einhändige Waffe, andere Paraphernalien oder Esoterica; du musst wenigstens ein Paraphernum in der Hand halten, um den Vorteil zu erlangen.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturgentalente</h2>\n<p>Mit der 1. Stufe und dann jeder geraden Stufe erhältst du ein Thaumaturgentalent.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitstalente<span style=\"float: right;\">2.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 2. Stufe und jeder weiteren geraden Stufe erlangst du ein Fertigkeitstalent. Um ein Fertigkeitstalent wählen zu können, musst du wenigstens den Kompetenzgrad Geübt in der assoziierten Fertigkeit besitzen.</p>\n<h2>Allgemeine Talente<span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen erlangst du ein Allgemeines Talent.</p>\n<h2>Blitzschnelle Reflexe<span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Deine Reflexe sind schnell wie der Blitz. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Reflexwürfe steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitsverbesserungen<span style=\"float: right;\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und jeder weiteren ungeraden Stufe erhältst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung. Du kannst eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung entweder nutzen, um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu erlangen oder um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu Experte zu verbessern.</p>\n<p>Mit der 7. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Experte zu Meister zu verbessern. Und mit der 15. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Meister zu Legende zu verbessern.</p>\n<h2>Abstammungstalente<span style=\"float: right;\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Neben dem Abstammungstalent, mit dem du das Spiel beginnst, erhältst du mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen ein Abstammungstalent.</p>\n<h2>Attributsverbesserungen<span style=\"float: right;\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 5 Stufen verbesserst du vier unterschiedliche Attributswerte. Du kannst auf diese Weise Attributswerte über 18 erhöhen. Sollte ein Attributswert unter 18 liegen, wird er mit einer Attributsverbesserung um 2 erhöht, andernfalls um 1.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturgenwaffenexpertise<span style=\"float: right;\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Du erlernst die geheimen Methoden, deine Waffe am effektivsten einzusetzen. Dein Kompetenzgrad im Umgang mit Waffenlosen Angriffen, Einfachen und Kriegswaffen verbessert sich zu Experte.</p>\n<h2>Zweites Paraphernum<span style=\"float: right;\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Du fügst deinen Werkzeugen ein weiteres Paraphernum hinzu. Wähle ein zweites Paraphernum einer anderen Art als dein erstes. Du erlangst den Ausgangsvorteil deines neuen Paraphernums.</p>\n<p>Während du ein Paraphernum in einer Hand hältst, kannst du es rasch gegen ein anderes mitgeführtes Paraphernum austauschen, um die Handlung des neuen Paraphernums zu nutzen. Hierzu nutzt du eine Freie Aktion der Kategorie Interagieren unmittelbar vor Nutzung der Handlung des zweiten Paraphernums. Dies erlaubt dir die Anforderung zu erfüllen, ein Paraphernum in der Hand zu haben, um es zu benutzen. Solltest du z.B. in einer Hand dein Laternen-Paraphernum und in der anderen eine Waffe halten und ein Kelch-Paraphernum mit dir führen, so könntest du die Laterne gegen den Kelch wechseln, um seine Reaktion zu nutzen.</p>\n<h2>Entschlossenheit<span style=\"float: right;\">7.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Verstand ist gestählt. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Willenswürfe steigt auf Meister. Wenn du bei einem Willenswurf einen Erfolg erzielst, zählt dieser als Kritischer Erfolg.</p>\n<h2>Paraphernumadept<span style=\"float: right;\">7.</span></h2>\n<p>Du vertiefst deine Verbindung zu einem deiner Paraphernalien und erweckst seine Adeptenkraft. Wähle eines deiner Paraphernalien und erlange für dieses Paraphernum den Adeptenvorteil.</p>\n<h2>Waffenspezialisierung<span style=\"float: right;\">7.</span></h2>\n<p>Du weißt mittlerweile, wie du mit den dir am besten bekannten Waffen größere Verletzungen zufügen kannst. Du verursachst 2 Punkte zusätzlichen Schaden mit jenen Waffen und Waffenlosen Angriffen, bei denen du den Kompetenzgrad Experte besitzt. Mit dem Kompetenzgrad Meister steigt dieser Zusatzschaden auf 3 und mit dem Kompetenzgrad Legende auf 4.</p>\n<h2>Schwachstellen intensivieren<span style=\"float: right;\">9.</span></h2>\n<p>Du lernst, dein Paraphernum zu nutzen, um eine Kreatur weiteranzugreifen, deren Schwachstellen du ausnutzt. Du erlangst den Schwachstellen ausnutzen-Vorteil aller deiner Paraphernalien, sowie die Aktion @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.HAmGozJwLAal5v82]{Schwachstellen intensivieren}.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturgenexpertise<span style=\"float: right;\">9.</span></h2>\n<p>Du erkennst tiefschürfende Geheimnisse des Übernatürlichen und deinen Gegnern fällt es schwerer, deinen Fähigkeiten zu widerstehen. Dein Kompetenzgrad für deinen Thaumaturgenklassen-SG steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<p>Du erlangst ferner eine zusätzliche Fertigkeitsverbesserung, welche du nur für Arkane Künste, Naturkunde, Okkultismus oder Religionskunde nutzen kannst.</p>\n<h2>Wachsame Sinne<span style=\"float: right;\">9.</span></h2>\n<p>Im Rahmen deiner Abenteuer hast du deine Sinne geschärft und gelernt, auf kleinste Details zu achten. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Wahrnehmung steigt auf Meister.</p>\n<h2>Mittelschwere Rüstungsexpertise<span style=\"float: right;\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Du kannst dich besser gegen Angriffe verteidigen. Dein Kompetenzgrad im Umgang mit Leichten Rüstungen, Mittelschweren Rüstungen und in Ungerüsteter Verteidigung steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Zweifacher Paraphernumadept<span style=\"float: right;\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Du verbesserst deine Verbindung zu deinem zweiten Paraphernum. Du erlangst den Adeptenvorteil deines zweiten Paraphernums.</p>\n<h2>Mächtige Entschlossenheit<span style=\"float: right;\">13.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein unglaubliches Training verleiht dir mentale Standhaftigkeit. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Willenswürfe steigt auf Legendär. Wenn du bei einem Willenswurf einen Erfolg erzielst, zählt dieser als Kritischer Erfolg. Solltest du bei einem Willenswurf einen Kritischen Fehlschlag landen, zählt dieser als normaler Fehlschlag. Scheitert dir ein Willenswurf gegen einen schadenerzeugenden Effekt, erleidest du nur halben Schaden.</p>\n<h2>Waffenmeisterschaft<span style=\"float: right;\">13.</span></h2>\n<p>Du verstehst deine Waffen nun vollends. Dein Kompetenzgrad im Umgang mit Waffenlosen Angriffen, Einfachen und Kriegswaffen verbessert sich zu Meister.</p>\n<h2>Drittes Paraphernum<span style=\"float: right;\">15.</span></h2>\n<p>Während du dem Ziel deiner Reise näherkommst, erlangst du dein letztes Paraphernum, das den Dreiersatz vervollständigt. Es muss eine andere Art Paraphernum sein als dein erstes und zweites Paraphernum. Du erlangst die Ausgangsvorteile und den Schwachstellen intensivieren-Vorteil deines neuen Paraphernums.</p>\n<h2>Gestählt<span style=\"float: right;\">15.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Körper ist daran gewöhnt, es mit körperlichen Gefahren zu tun zu haben und Krankheitserregern, Giftstoffen und anderem regelmäßig ausgesetzt zu sein. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zähigkeitswürfe verbessert sich zu Meister. Erzielst du bei einem Zähigkeitswurf einen Erfolg, so zählt dies als Kritischer Erfolg.</p>\n<h2>Mächtige Waffenspezialisierung<span style=\"float: right;\">15.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Zusatzschaden aus Waffenspezialisierung steigt bei Waffen und Waffenlosen Angriffen, in denen du den Kompetenzgrad Experte besitzt, auf 4. Mit dem Kompetenzgrad Meister steigt dieser Zusatzschaden auf 6 und mit dem Kompetenzgrad Legende auf 8.</p>\n<h2>Paraphernumparagon<span style=\"float: right;\">17.</span></h2>\n<p>Du entschlüsselst die letzten Geheimnisse eines Paraphernums. Wähle ein Paraphernum, für das du bereits den Adeptenvorteil besitzt; du erlangst den Paragonvorteil für dieses Paraphernum.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturgenmeisterschaft<span style=\"float: right;\">17.</span></h2>\n<p>Du wirst zu einem Meister der paranormalen Phänomene und die Kraft deiner Esoterica wächst. Dein Kompetenzgrad für deinen Thaumaturgenklassen-SG steigt auf Meister.</p>\n<p>Du erlangst ferner eine zusätzliche Fertigkeitsverbesserung, welche du nur für Arkane Künste, Naturkunde, Okkultismus oder Religionskunde nutzen kannst.</p>\n<h2>Mittelschwere Rüstungsmeisterschaft<span style=\"float: right;\">19.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Können im Umgang mit Leichten und Mittelschweren Rüstungen verbessert sich, sodass du besser Schlägen ausweichen kannst. Dein Kompetenzgrad im Umgang mit Leichten und Mittelschweren Rüstungen sowie für Waffenlose Verteidigung steigt auf Meister.</p>\n<h2>Unbegrenzte Esoterica<span style=\"float: right;\">19.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Verständnis deiner Esoterica ist derart vollständig, dass du ohne Nachzudenken auf deine mystischen Werkzeuge zurückgreifen kannst. Du kannst Schwachstellen ausnutzen oder Schwachstellen intensivieren als Freie Aktion nutzen statt als einzelne Aktion, wobei die Häufigkeit immer noch nur Einmal pro Runde ist.</p>"

Deine Macht stammt von einem machtvollen Wesen, das dich dazu auserkoren hat, seine Ziele in der Welt zu verwirklichen. Diese Wesenheit ist meist geheimnisumwoben, schwer greifbar und offenbart nur wenig ihrer Identität und Beweggründe. Sie vermittelt dir ihre Wünsche in Form von Omen, Träumen oder ähnlichen subtilen Dingen, statt auf Worte zurückzugreifen.</p>\n<p>Statt direkt mit dir zu interagieren, gewährt dir dein Schutzherr Zauber und andere magische Fähigkeiten durch einen Vertrauten, der als Kanal für diese Kräfte dient. - Und dich vielleicht auch im Auge behält, dass du auch ja die Ziele deines nebulösen Schutzherrn nicht außer Acht lässt.</p>\n<p>Auf der 1. Stufe wählst du einen Schutzherrn aus, der bestimmt welcher magischen Tradition du folgst, welche Fertigkeit und welchen besonderen Hexerei-Zaubertrick du erhältst und welchen zusätzlichen Zauber dein Vertrauter lernt.</p>\n<h3><strong>Vertrauter</strong></h3>\n<p>Dein Schutzherr stellt dir einen Vertrauten zur Seite, eine mystische Kreatur, die dir Zauber beibringt und sie für dich bewahrt. Dieser Vertraute folgt den üblichen Regeln für Vertraute, auch wenn es sich bei ihm um den direkten Kanal zwischen dir und deinem Schutzherrn handelt, und er deshalb wesentlich mächtiger als andere Vertraute ist. Dein Vertrauter erhält eine zusätzliche Vertrautenfähigkeit und weitere zusätzliche Fähigkeiten auf der 6., 12., und 18. Stufe.</p>\n<p><strong>Zauber:</strong> Dein Vertrauter ist Quell und Speicher der Zauber, die dir dein Schutzherr gewährt. Du musst mit deinem Vertrauten in Kontakt treten, um deine Zauber jeden Tag vorzubereiten, wie unter Hexenzauberei beschrieben. Dein Vertrauter kennt zu Beginn 10 Zaubertricks, fünf Zauber des 1. Grades und einen weiteren Zauber, der durch die Grundlegende Lektion deines Schutzherrn bestimmt wird. Diese Zauber wählst du aus den Gewöhnlichen Zaubern der Tradition, die durch deinen Schutzherrn festgelegt wird, oder aus jenen Zaubern deiner Tradition, zu denen du Zugang hast.</p>\n<p>Bei jedem Stufenaufstieg lehrt dein Schutzherr deinem Vertrauten zwei neue Zauber eines beliebigen Grades, die du wirken kannst, die er aus den Gewöhnlichen Zaubern deiner Tradition oder anderen Zaubern wählt, zu denen du Zugang hast. Talente können deinem Vertrauten zusätzliche Zauber gewähren.</p>\n<p><strong>Zauber lernen:</strong> Dein Vertrauter kann unabhängig von deinem Schutzherrn Zauber lernen. Er lernt Zauber, indem er Schriftrollen von Zaubern, die auf der Zauberliste deiner Tradition stehen, in einem 1 Stunde dauernden Prozess physisch verzehrt. Außerdem kannst du die Erkundungsaktivität Zauber lernen nutzen, um eine besondere geschriebene Version eines Zaubers herzustellen, die dein Vertrauter dann Verzehren kann wie eine Schriftrolle. Du und dein Vertrauter könnt zusammen auch die Aktivität Zauber erlernen nutzen, um deinem Vertrauten einen Zauber, den ein anderer Vertrauter einer Hexe beherrscht, beizubringen. Beide Vertraute müssen dafür während der gesamten Zeit der Aktivität anwesend sein, der Zauber muss auf der Zauberliste deiner Tradition stehen und du musst die üblichen Kosten der Aktivität aufwenden, meist in Form eines Geschenks oder einer Opfergabe an den Schutzherrn des anderen Vertrauten. Du kannst mit dem Vertrauten einer anderen Hexe keine Zauber vorbereiten.</p>\n<p><strong>Quasi unsterblich:</strong> Wenn dein Vertrauter stirbt, sendet dir dein Schutzherr bei deiner nächsten täglichen Vorbereitung einen neuen Vertrauten. Der neue Vertraute kann eine Kopie oder Reinkarnation deines alten Vertrauten sein oder eine gänzlich neue Wesenheit, allerdings kennt sie unabhängig davon alle Zauber, die dein alter Vertrauter gekannt hat. Der Tod deines Vertrauten hat keine Auswirkung auf Zauber, die du bereits vorbereitet hast.</p>\n<h2>Hexereien</h2>\n<p>Als bevorzugter Beauftragter deines Schutzherrn kannst du seine Macht im Rahmen einer direkteren magischen Intervention anrufen. Eine Hexerei ist ein von deinem Schutzherrn geformter und modifizierter Zauber und wird dir direkt durch deinen Vertrauen geschickt - du besitzt ihn daher nicht als Fähigkeit, die du direkt ohne diese Elemente nutzen könntest. Dein Schutzherr erwartet, dass du seine Interessen förderst, und hält wenig davon, ständig um Hilfe gebeten zu werden; daher kannst du pro Zug nur eine Hexerei nutzen. Jeder Versuch, im selben Zug eine weitere Hexerei zu wirken, scheitert und verbraucht die eingesetzten Aktionen.</p>\n<p>Hexereien sind eine Unterart der Fokuszauber. Um einen Fokuszauber zu wirken, musst du 1 Fokuspunkt aufwenden. Dein Fokusvorrat fasst zu Beginn 1 Fokuspunkt. Du füllst deinen Fokusvorrat während deiner täglichen Vorbereitungen auf. Außerdem kannst du die Aktivität Fokus erneuern nutzen, um 1 Fokuspunkt nach 10 Minuten zurückzuerlangen, in denen du mit deinem Vertrauten kommunizierst. Fokuszauber werden wie Zaubertricks automatisch im Grad auf deine halbe Stufe (aufgerundet) erhöht. Sie erfordern keine Zauberplätze und können auch nicht mittels Zauberplätzen gewirkt werden. Manche Talente können dir weitere Fokuszauber verschaffen oder deinen Fokusvorrat erhöhen; allerdings fasst dein Fokusvorrat maximal 3 Fokuspunkte.</p>\n<p>Du erlernst die Hexerei @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.rMOI8JFJ0nT2mrCF]{Flüchtiger Vertrauter} oder @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.aq1yonHeYpbaj3XI]{Marionette des Schutzherren} (deine Wahl). Diese Hexerei schützt deinen Vertrauten vor Schaden oder lässt dich ihm Anweisungen erteilen. Die meisten anderen Hexereien erlernst du über deine Hexenlektionen.</p>\n<p><strong>Hexerei-Zaubertricks</strong></p>\n<p>Hexerei-Zaubertricks sind besondere Hexereien, die keine Fokuspunkte kosten. Du kannst sie also beliebig oft wirken. Die Begrenzung auf eine Hexerei pro Runde bleibt allerdings bestehen. Hexerei-Zaubertricks erlangst du zusätzlich zu den Zaubertricks, die du mittels Hexenzauberei auswählst, und werden nicht gegen das Maximum der Zaubertricks gezählt, die du vorbereiten kannst. Du erlangst einen Hexerei-Zaubertrick passend zu deinem gewählten Schutzherrn.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitstalente<span style=\"float:right\">2.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 2. Stufe und jeder weiteren geraden Stufe erlangst du ein Fertigkeitstalent. Um ein Fertigkeitstalent wählen zu können, musst du wenigstens den Kompetenzgrad Geübt in der assoziierten Fertigkeit besitzen.</p>\n<h2>Hexentalente<span style=\"float:right\">2.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 2. Stufe und danach mit jeder geraden Stufe erhältst du ein Hexentalent.</p>\n<h2>Allgemeine Talente<span style=\"float:right\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen erlangst du ein Allgemeines Talent.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitsverbesserungen<span style=\"float:right\">3.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 3. Stufe und jeder weiteren ungeraden Stufe erhältst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung. Du kannst eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung entweder nutzen, um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu erlangen oder um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu Experte zu verbessern.</p>\n<p>Mit der 7. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Experte zu Meister zu verbessern und mit der 15. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Meister zu Legende zu verbessern.</p>\n<h2>Abstammungstalente<span style=\"float:right\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Neben dem Abstammungstalent, mit dem du das Spiel beginnst, erhältst du mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen ein Abstammungstalent.</p>\n<h2>Attributsverbesserungen<span style=\"float:right\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Neben der Verbesserung, die dir deine Klasse mit der 1. Stufe verleiht, erhältst du vier freie Attributsverbesserungen, die du anderen Attributsmodifikatoren zuweist.</p>\n<p>Mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle jeweils weiteren 5 Stufen erhältst du vier freie Attributsverbesserungen für jeweils unterschiedliche Attributsmodifikatoren. Sollte ein Attributsmodifikator bereits +4 oder höher sein, so sind zwei Verbesserungen nötig, um ihn um 1 zu verbessern; da du immer nur eine Verbesserung einem Modifikator zuweisen kannst, erhältst du in diesem Fall mit der ersten Verbesserung noch keine Erhöhung des Modifikators, sondern erst mit der zweiten Verbesserung mehrere Stufen später.</p>\n<h2>Magische Zähigkeit<span style=\"float:right\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Die Macht deines Schutzherrn steigert deine körperliche Widerstandskraft. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zähigkeitswürfe steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Zauberexperte<span style=\"float:right\">7.</span></h2>\n<p>Du hast gelernt die Macht, die dir dein Schutzherr zur Verfügung gestellt hat, besser zu kontrollieren. dein Kompetenzgrad für Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Ausgeprägte Reflexe<span style=\"float:right\">9.</span></h2>\n<p>Deine Reflexe sind schnell wie der Blitz und helfen dir, Gefahren zu vermeiden. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Reflexwürfe steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Ausgeprägte Wahrnehmung<span style=\"float:right\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Du achtest auf Gefahren. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Wahrnehmung steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Waffenexpertise<span style=\"float:right\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Allein durch Erfahrung hast du dich im Führen deiner Waffen verbessert. Dein Kompetenzgrad im Umgang mit Einfachen Waffen und Waffenlosen Angriffen steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Defensive Robe<span style=\"float:right\">13.</span></h2>\n<p>Der Fluss der Magie und deine Ausbildung helfen dir, Angriffen zu entgehen. Dein Kompetenzgrad in Ungerüsteter Verteidigung steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Waffenspezialisierung<span style=\"float:right\">13.</span></h2>\n<p>Du hast gelernt, wie du mit den dir am besten bekannten Waffen größere Verletzungen zufügen kannst. Du verursachst 2 Punkte zusätzlichen Schaden mit jenen Waffen und Waffenlosen Angriffen, bei denen du den Kompetenzgrad Experte besitzt. Mit dem Kompetenzgrad Meister steigt dieser Zusatzschaden auf 3 und mit dem Kompetenzgrad Legende auf 4.</p>\n<h2>Zaubermeister<span style=\"float:right\">15.</span></h2>\n<p>Du hast die Magie deines Schutzherrn gemeistert. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG für Hexenzauberei steigt auf Meister.</p>\n<h2>Willenskraft der Hexe<span style=\"float:right\">17.</span></h2>\n<p>Die Verbindung zu deinem Vertrauten hat deinen Verstand gestählt. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Willenswürfe steigt auf Meister. Wenn du bei einem Willenswurf einen Erfolg erzielst, zählt dieser als Kritischer Erfolg.</p>\n<h2>Gabe des Schutzherrn<span style=\"float:right\">19.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Schutzherr gewährt dir die Macht, wahrlich unglaubliche Zauber zu wirken. Du erhältst einen einzelnen Zauberplatz des 10. Grades und kannst darin einen Zauber vorbereiten, den du mit Hexenzauberei wirken kannst. Du erhältst einen einzelnen Zauberplatz 10. Grades. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Zauberplätzen können diese nicht zusammen mit Fähigkeiten genutzt werden, welche dir erlauben, Zauber zu wirken, ohne Zauberplätze aufzuwenden, oder mit Fähigkeiten, die dir weitere Zauberplätze verleihen. Du erhältst über deine Stufenprogression keinen weiteren Zauberplatz des 10. Grades. Du kannst jedoch das Talent @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.SelPslNtTfzxp7fs]{Wahrheit des Schutzherrn} wählen, um einen zweiten Zauberplatz zu erlangen.</p>\n<h2>Zauberlegende<span style=\"float:right\">19.</span></h2>\n<p>Du hast deine Kontrolle über die Magie deines Schutzherrn perfektioniert. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG für Hexenzauberei steigt auf Legende.</p>\n<h1>Schutzherren</h1>\n<p>Wenn dein Schutzherr erstmals Kontakt zu dir aufnimmt, enthüllt er meistens wenig von sich, was über spezifische Manifestationen oder verschwommene Details hinausgeht - vielleicht siehst du Augen in den Schatten des Waldes oder hörst das wortlose Wispern einer Stimme in der eisigen Tundra, ehe dann dein Vertrauter erscheint. Dein Schutzherr könnte eine mächtige Vettel, ein Feenherrscher, eine Gottheit oder ein Halbgott, ein Erzteufel oder eine ähnlich mächtige Wesenheit sein. Er könnte sich sogar aus mehreren solchen Wesen zusammensetzen, die gemeinsam handeln. Es ist aber dir überlassen, seine Identität herauszufinden, während du weitere seiner Lektionen erlernst. Manche Schutzherren besitzen viele Facetten, erscheinen unterschiedlichen Hexen in verschiedenen Verkleidungen und verleihen zudem unterschiedliche Kräfte. In manchen Fällen kennt eine Hexe die Identität ihres Schutzherrn, während viele seiner Aspekte unklar bleiben; vielleicht kennt sie seinen Namen, aber nicht seine Motive. Vielleicht kennt sie auch seine Identität, ist aber verflucht, sie niemals zu enthüllen.</p>\n<p>Dein Schutzherr bestimmt die folgenden Elemente:</p>\n<p><strong>Zauberliste</strong> Du nutzt diese magische Tradition und Zauberliste.</p>\n<p><strong>Schutzherrenfertigkeit</strong> Du erhältst den Kompetenzgrad Geübt in der Fertigkeit, die mit der magischen Tradition deines Schutzherren assoziiert wird.</p>\n<p><strong>Grundlegende Lektion</strong> Dies ist die erste Lektion, die dich dein Schutzherr lehrt, und ist für jeden Schutzherrn individuell.</p>\n<p><strong>Vertrautenfähigkeit</strong> Dein Vertrauter erhält zwei Bonusfähigkeiten; eine davon wird über diesen Eintrag bestimmt und repräsentiert den Einfluss deines Schutzherrn. Der Vorteil kann nur einmal pro Runde eintreten, wenn du Zauber wirken oder Zauber aufrechterhalten nutzt, um eine Hexerei zu wirken oder aufrechtzuerhalten. Du wählst, ob der Effekt vor oder nach den Effekten des Wirkens oder Aufrechterhaltens eintritt.</p>\n<p> Aus folgenden Schutzherren kannst du wählen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.9OwWgOP8ZWxTAqbg]{Die Ewige Abscheu}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.mFqMSQoNl0NMDklv]{Die Flamme des Glaubens}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.FdLx4VODZEYLGOK9]{Der Glyphenträger}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.r2ZPRAw9c3VGZi8A]{Der Sternenlose Schatten}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.9c57R18pfgfqlBCD]{Die Stille im Schnee}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.e0VhUyjz1clW3sC4]{Der Wächter der Wildnis}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.ghIsqhEsJTvjJiNl]{Der Weber der Schicksalsfäden}</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Hexenlektionen</h1>\n<p>Das Wissen einer Hexe stammt aus Lektionen ihres Schutzherrn, die du über Talente wie Grundlegende Lektion auswählen kannst.

Stufe verleiht, erhältst du die Vorteile deiner gewählten Abstammung und deines Hintergrundes.</p>\n<h2>Anfangskompetenzgrade</h2>\n<p>Mit der 1. Stufe erlangst du eine Reihe von Kompetenzgraden, die deine Grundausbildung repräsentieren. Du findest sie am Beginn dieser Klassenbeschreibung.</p>\n<h2>Magierzauberei</h2>\n<p>Dank umfangreicher Studien und Übungen kannst du arkane Kräfte zähmen und formen, um mit akademischer Genauigkeit Zauber zu wirken. Du bist ein Zauberkundiger und kannst mittels der Aktivität Zauber wirken Zauber der arkanen Tradition nutzen. Als Magier sind deine Anrufungen wahrscheinlich genaue Definitionen, welche Kräfte du einsetzen und wie du sie formen willst. Deine Gesten formen und dirigieren deine Magie, während Kreise aus arkanen Runen aufblitzen.</p>\n<p>Auf der 1. Stufe kannst du jeden Morgen bis zu zwei Zauber des 1. Grades und fünf Zaubertricks aus deinem Zauberbuch (siehe unten) vorbereiten plus einen zusätzlichen Zaubertrick und pro dir zugänglichem Zaubergrad einen Zauber deiner gewählten Arkanen Schule. Vorbereitete Zauber bleiben dir verfügbar, bis du sie wirkst oder bis du deine Zauber erneut vorbereitest. Die Anzahl an Zaubern, die du jeden Tag wirken kannst, wird als deine Zauberplätze bezeichnet.</p>\n<p>Wenn deine Magierstufe steigt, steigt auch die Zahl deiner Zauber am Tag, ebenso kannst du schließlich Zauber höheren Grades wirken - siehe auch die Tabelle Magierzauber am Tag.</p>\n<p>Manche deiner Zauber verlangen von dir einen Zauberangriffswurf, um festzustellen, wie effektiv sie sind. Bei anderen müssen deine Gegner gegen deinen Zauber-SG würfeln - in der Regel im Rahmen von Rettungswürfen. Da Intelligenz dein Schlüsselattribut ist, nutzen deine Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG deinen Intelligenzmodifikator.</p>\n<h3><strong>Erhöhte Zauber</strong></h3>\n<p>Sobald du Zauberplätze des 2. oder höheren Grades erlangst, kannst du diese Zauberplätze mit stärkeren Versionen von Zaubern niederen Grades belegen. Du erhöht den Grad des fraglichen Zaubers auf den Grad des genutzten Zauberplatzes. Viele Zauber weisen spezifische Verbesserungen auf, wenn sie auf bestimmte Grade erhöht werden.</p>\n<h3><strong>Zaubertricks</strong></h3>\n<p>Einige deiner Zauber fallen in die Kategorie Zaubertrick. Ein Zaubertrick verwendet keinen Zauberplatz. Du kannst einen Zaubertrick beliebig oft am Tag wirken. Dabei wird sein Grad automatisch auf die Hälfte deiner Stufe (aufgerundet) erhöht, was dem höchsten Zaubergrad entspricht, den du als Magier wirken kannst. Als Magier der 1. Stufe wirkst du Zaubertricks auf dem 1. Grad und als Magier der 5. Stufe als Zauber des 3. Grades.</p>\n<h3><strong>Zauberbuch</strong></h3>\n<p>Von jedem arkanen Zauber gibt es eine schriftliche Version, die meistens in einem Zauberbuch niedergeschrieben wird. Du beginnst mit einem kostenlosen @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.FOWF5f0tCaApv9RE]{Zauberbuch} im Wert von maximal 10 SM, welches du jeden Tag studieren musst, um deine Zauber vorzubereiten. Die Form, das Aussehen und den Namen deines Zauberbuches bestimmst du selbst. Es könnte ein altes Buch mit Ledereinband sein oder eine Reihe dünner Metallscheiben, die von einem Messingring zusammengehalten werden. Es könnte einen esoterischen Namen haben wie <em>Das Große Werk der Stillen Schatten</em> oder eine akademischere Bezeichnung wie <em>Fortschrittliche Pyromantische Nutzungen der Jalmerischen Elementartheorie</em>.</p>\n<p>Das Zauberbuch enthält 10 arkane Zaubertricks und fünf arkane Zauber des 1. Grades deiner Wahl aus den Gewöhnlichen Zaubern der arkanen Zauberliste und/oder anderen arkanen Zaubern, zu denen du Zugang hast. Füge ferner zwei Zauber des 1. Grades deiner Arkanen Schule hinzu (außer du hast dich der Schule der Vereinheitlichten Magischen Theorie verschrieben, die weiter hinten beschrieben wird). Wenn du eine Stufe aufsteigst, füge zwei weitere arkane Zauber deinem Zauberbuch hinzu, die du vom Grad her wirken könntest; wähle diese Zauber aus den Gewöhnlichen arkanen Zaubern oder jenen, zu denen du ansonsten Zugang hast und die du mittels Zauber erlernen lernen kannst. Wenn du Zauberplätze eines neuen Zaubergrades erlangst, fügst du einen weiteren Zauber vom Lehrplan deiner Zauberschule hinzu (außer du gehörst der Schule der Vereinheitlichten Magischen Theorie an).</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Stufe</th>\n<th>Zaubertricks</th>\n<th>1.</th>\n<th>2.</th>\n<th>3.</th>\n<th>4.</th>\n<th>5.</th>\n<th>6.</th>\n<th>7.</th>\n<th>8.</th>\n<th>9.</th>\n<th>10.</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* Das Klassenmerkmal Erzmagier verleiht dir einen Zauberplatz des 10.

Du erlangst einen besonderen Vorteil abhängig vom Thema deiner Magisterarbeit. Du findest einige mögliche Magisterarbeitsthemen im Folgenden; deine tatsächliche Magisterarbeit hat möglicherweise einen viel längeren und technischeren Titel wie <em>„Zu den Methoden der Zauberinterpolation und der Genesis eines neuen Verständnisses zu den Bausteinen der Magie“</em>.</p>\n<p>Mögliche Arkane Meisterarbeiten kannst du hier finden:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.89zWKD2CN7nRu2xp]{Experimentelle Zaubermodifikationen}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Klb35AwlkNrq1gpB]{Steckenmacher}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.SNZ46g3u7U6x0XJj]{Verbesserte Vertrauteneinstimmung}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.QzWXMCSGNfvvpYgF]{Zauber austauschen}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.OAcxS625AXSGrQIC]{Zauber verbinden}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Arkane Schule</h2>\n<p>Die meisten Magier erlangen ihr Wissen und ihre Zauber im Rahmen einer formellen Ausbildung an einer Akademie wie dem Arkanamirium oder der Magaambya. Auf der 1. Stufe wählst du deine Arkane Schule, welche dir magische Fähigkeiten verleiht. Du erlangst zusätzliche Zauber und Zauberplätze für Zauber auf dem Lehrplan deiner Schule. Einige Magier gehören der Schule der Vereinheitlichten Magischen Theorie an; diese versucht, eine neue Denkweise zu schaffen, indem man unabhängig studiert und seine Informationen aus allen möglichen Texten und einer Vielzahl an Lehrmeistern erlangt. Ein Magier dieser Schule besitzt zwar nicht den Fokus einer formellen Ausbildung, verfügt dafür aber über größere Flexibilität.</p>\n<p>Deine Arkane Schule ist der Kern deiner Zauberkunst. Sie ist das Gebiet der Magie, auf welches du dich spezialisiert hat. Vielleicht hast du eine altehrwürdige Magierakademie besucht, vielleicht bist du bei einem Erzmagier in die Lehre gegangen oder hast dir die Zauberei aus von anderen erworbenen Bü- chern selbst beigebracht. Doch in jedem Fall bestimmt deine Arkane Schule die Ausrichtung deiner Magie und welche Zauber auf ihrem Lehrplan stehen!</p>\n<p><strong>Lehrplanzauber:</strong> Du fügst automatisch einige der im Lehrplan deiner Schule aufgeführten Zauber deinem Zauberbuch hinzu. Auf der 1. Stufe kannst du einen Zaubertrick und zwei Zauber des 1. Grades deiner Wahl hinzufügen. Sobald du die Fähigkeit zum Wirken von Magierzaubern eines neuen Grades erlangst, wähle einen der Zauber dieses Grades von deinem Lehrplan und füge ihn deinem Zauberbuch hinzu. Ein hochgestelltes „U“ verweist auf einen Zauber der Seltenheitskategorie Ungewöhnlich; dein SL könnte dir gestatten, Zauber auf dem Lehrplan auszutauschen oder Zauber hinzuzufügen, welche stark zum Thema der Schule passen.</p>\n<p><strong>Zauberplätze:</strong> Wenn du täglich deine Zauber vorbereitest, kannst du einen zusätzlichen Zaubertrick von deinem Lehrplan wählen. Du erhältst ferner zu jedem dir verfügbaren Magierzaubergrad einen zusätzlichen Zauberplatz, in dem du einen Zauber desselben Grades vom Lehrplan deiner Schule vorbereiten kannst, egal auf welchem Weg du ihn deinem Zauberbuch hinzugefügt hast.</p>\n<p><strong>Schulenzauber:</strong> Schulenzauber sind eine Unterkategorie des Fokuszaubers. Zum Wirken eines Fokuszaubers musst du 1 Fokuspunkt aufwenden. Zu Beginn verfügst du über einen Fokusvorrat, der 1 Punkt fasst. Du kannst deinen Fokusvorrat während deiner täglichen Vorbereitungen wieder auffüllen. Ferner erlangst du 1 Fokuspunkt zurück, wenn du die Handlung Fokus erneuern nutzt und 10 Minuten lang dein Zauberbuch studierst oder dich mit arkanen Forschungen befasst.</p>\n<p>Ein Fokuszauber wird automatisch wie ein normaler Zaubertrick auf einen Grad in Höhe deiner halben Stufe (aufgerundet) erhöht. Fokuszauber benötigen keine Zauberplätze und können auch nicht über Zauberplätze gewirkt werden. Manche Talente verschaffen dir weitere Fokuszauber und jeder neue Fokuszauber erhöht das Fassungsvermögen deines Fokusvorrates um 1 Punkt - bis auf maximal 3 Punkte.</p>\n<p>Du erlernst den Grundlegenden Schulenzauber, welcher für deine Schule einzigartig ist.

Während deiner täglichen Zaubervorbereitungen, kannst du einen deiner Gegenstände zu deinem Gebundenen Gegenstand bestimmen. Meistens ist es ein mit Zauberei assoziierter Gegenstand, z.B. ein Ring, Zauberstecken oder Zauberstab, du kannst aber auch eine Waffe oder einen anderen Gegenstand wählen. Du erhältst die Freie Aktion @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.v82XtjAVN4ffgVVR]{Gebundenen Gegenstand auszehren}.</p>\n<h2>Fertigkeitstalente<span style=\"float:right\">2.</span></h2>\n<p>Mit der 2.

Stufe und jeder weiteren ungraden Stufe erhältst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung. Du kannst eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung entweder nutzen, um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu erlangen oder um in einer Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt zu Experte zu verbessern.</p>\n<p>Mit der 7. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Experte zu Meister zu verbessern. Und mit der 15. Stufe kannst du eine Fertigkeitsverbesserung alternativ nutzen, um den Kompetenzgrad in einer Fertigkeit von Meister zu Legende zu verbessern.</p>\n<h2>Abstammungstalente<span style=\"float:right\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Neben dem Abstammungstalent, mit dem du das Spiel beginnst, erhältst du mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle weiteren 4 Stufen ein Abstammungstalent.</p>\n<h2>Attributsverbesserungen<span style=\"float:right\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Neben der Verbesserung, die dir deine Klasse mit der 1. Stufe verleiht, erhältst du vier freie Attributsverbesserungen, die du anderen Attributsmodifikatoren zuweist.</p>\n<p>Mit der 5. Stufe und dann alle jeweils weiteren 5 Stufen erhältst du vier freie Attributsverbesserungen für jeweils unterschiedliche Attributsmodifikatoren. Sollte ein Attributsmodifikator bereits +4 oder höher sein, so sind zwei Verbesserungen nötig, um ihn um 1 zu verbessern; da du immer nur eine Verbesserung einem Modifikator zuweisen kannst, erhältst du in diesem Fall mit der ersten Verbesserung noch keine Erhöhung des Modifikators, sondern erst mit der zweiten Verbesserung mehrere Stufen später.</p>\n<h2>Ausgeprägte Reflexe<span style=\"float:right\">5.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein Bauchgefühl sagt dir, wann es an der Zeit ist in Deckung zu hechten.

Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Magische Zähigkeit<span style=\"float:right\">9.</span></h2>\n<p>Magische Macht härtet deinen Leib ab. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zähigkeitswürfe steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Ausgeprägte Wahrnehmung<span style=\"float:right\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Du achtest auf Gefahren. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Wahrnehmung steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Waffenexpertise<span style=\"float:right\">11.</span></h2>\n<p>Dank deiner Erfahrungen kannst du Waffen effektiver führen. Du erlangst den Kompetenzgrad Experte im Umgang mit Einfachen Waffen und Waffenlosen Angriffen.</p>\n<h2>Defensive Robe<span style=\"float:right\">13.</span></h2>\n<p>Der Fluss der Magie und deine Ausbildung helfen dir, Angriffen zu entgehen. Dein Kompetenzgrad in Ungerüsteter Verteidigung steigt auf Experte.</p>\n<h2>Waffenspezialisierung<span style=\"float:right\">13.</span></h2>\n<p>Du weißt mittlerweile, wie du mit den dir am besten bekannten Waffen größere Verletzungen zufügen kannst. Du verursachst 2 Punkte zusätzlichen Schaden mit jenen Waffen und Waffenlosen Angriffen, bei denen du den Kompetenzgrad Experte besitzt. Mit dem Kompetenzgrad Meister steigt dieser Zusatzschaden auf 3 und mit dem Kompetenzgrad Legende auf 4.</p>\n<h2>Zaubermeister<span style=\"float:right\">15.</span></h2>\n<p>Du hast die Kräfte des Arkanen gemeistert. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Zauberangriffswürfe und Zauber-SG steigt auf Meister.</p>\n<h2>Willenskraft des Arkanisten<span style=\"float:right\">17.</span></h2>\n<p>Dein gestählter Verstand ist ein komplexes Labyrinth, in dem sich jene verirren, die ihn beherrschen wollen. Dein Kompetenzgrad für Willenswürfe steigt auf Meister. Wenn du bei einem Willenswurf einen Erfolg erzielst, zählt dieser als Kritischer Erfolg.</p>\n<h2>Erzmagier<span style=\"float:right\">19.</span></h2>\n<p>Du befehligst die mächtigste arkane Magie und kannst einen wahrlich unglaublichen Zauber wirken. Du erhältst einen einzelnen Zauberplatz des 10. Grades und kannst darin einen arkanen Zauber vorbereiten. Allerdings erhältst du über deine Stufenprogression keinen weiteren Zauberplatz des 10. Grades. Du kannst jedoch das Talent @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.tP26mgaFPpr6df1i]{Erzmagiermacht} wählen, um einen zweiten Zauberplatz zu erlangen. Du kannst Zauberplätze des 10.

Sollte es der Gruppe längere Zeit nicht möglich sein, nützliche Gegenstände zu erwerben oder herzustellen, besitzen die SC wahrscheinlich Münzen und Wertsachen in Mengen, aber weniger nützliche Ausrüstung.

Alternativ gibt es die formfreie Erkundung, welche meistens in der Wildnis spielt und als Spielwiese bezeichnet wird.

Normale Deckung gibt dir einen Situationsbonus von +2 auf deine RK, auf Rettungswürfe gegen Flächeneffekte und auf Fertigkeitswürfe für Heimlichkeit zum Schleichen, Verstecken oder anderweitig der Entdeckung zu entgehen. Du kannst dies zu Starker Deckung verbessern, indem du die Einfache Aktion In Deckung gehen ausführst. Dadurch erhöht sich der Situationsbonus auf +4. Wenn die Deckung sehr leicht ist, z.B. wenn sie durch eine andere Kreatur zustande kommt, hast du Schwache Deckung, die dir eine Situationsbonus von +1 auf deine RK gibt. Eine Kreatur, die\nnormale Deckung oder Starke Deckung hat, kann einen Fertigkeitswurf für Heimlichkeit zum Verstecken ablegen. Schwache Deckung ist dafür jedoch nicht ausreichend.</p>\n<p>Deckung ist immer relativ, d.h. du kannst einer Kreatur gegenüber Deckung haben, aber einer anderen gegenüber nicht. Deckung ist nur relevant, wenn der Pfad zu deinem Ziel teilweise blockiert ist. Wenn sich eine Kreatur vollständig hinter einer Wand oder ähnlichem befindet, hast du keine freie Schusslinie (Seite 457) und kannst sie normalerweise nicht als Ziel auswählen.</p>\n<p>Der SL kann normalerweise schnell entscheiden, ob dein Ziel Deckung hat. Wenn du dir unsicher bist oder es genau wissen musst, so ziehe eine Linie vom Mittelpunkt deiner Angriffsfläche zum Mittelpunkt der Angriffsfläche des Ziels. Wenn diese Linie durch Gelände verläuft, das den Effekt blockieren könnte, hat die Kreatur normale Deckung oder Starke Deckung, falls die Blockade extrem ist oder das Ziel In Deckung gegangen ist. Wenn die Linie dagegen durch eine Kreatur verläuft, hat das Ziel Schwache Deckung. Um Deckung gegen einen Flächeneffekt zu bestimmen, ziehst du die Linie vom Ursprungspunkt des Effektes zum Mittelpunkt der Angriffsfläche einer Kreatur.</p>\n<h2>Deckung und Grosse Kreaturen</h2>\n<p>Befindet sich zwischen dir und deinem Ziel eine Kreatur, die zwei oder mehr Größenkategorien größer ist als sowohl du als auch dein Ziel, dann blockiert diese Kreatur den Effekt derart, dass sie normale Deckung statt nur Schwacher Deckung gewährt. Der SL kann entscheiden, dass eine Kreatur keine Deckung von Gelände erhält, wenn dieses signifikant kleiner ist als die Kreatur. Ein Riesiger Drache würde beispielsweise wahrscheinlich hinter\neiner 30 cm breiten Säule keine Deckung bekommen.</p>\n<h2>Besondere Umstände</h2>\n<p>In manchen Situationen erlaubt es dir dein SL vielleicht, die Deckung von Kreaturen zu umgehen. Wenn du dich direkt an einer Schießscharte befindest, kannst du ohne Nachteil schießen, hast aber selbst Starke Deckung gegenüber jemanden, der von weiter weg auf dich schießt. Der SL kann dir auch erlauben, Deckung zu reduzieren oder zu umgehen, indem du dich zum Schießen um eine Ecke lehnst. Dies erfordert üblicherweise eine Aktion zur Vorbereitung; der SL könnte dann zur Bestimmung der Deckung statt vom Mittelpunkt deiner Angriffsfläche aus von einer Ecke aus messen.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4><strong>Seitenbalken </strong>@UUID[.ok2IPQGIrxj8h1vs]{Kämpfe in drei Dimensionen}</h4>\n</section>"

Während du diesen Zustand hast, besitzt du zugleich den Zustand Bewusstlos. Sterbend besitzt stets einen Zustandswert. Solltest du jemals Sterbend 4 erreichen, stirbst du. Wenn du den Zustand sterbend hast, musst du jeweils zu Beginn deines Zuges einen Erholungswurf ablegen, um zu bestimmen, ob sich deine Lage verbessert oder verschlechtert.</p>\n<p>Wenn du durch einen Erfolg bei einem Erholungswurf den Zustand Sterbend verlierst, aber immer noch 0 Trefferpunkte hast, behältst du den Zustand Bewusstlos, kannst aber erwachen, wie bei Bewusstlos beschrieben. Du verlierst den Zustand Sterbend automatisch und erwachst, solltest du jemals 1 Trefferpunkt oder mehr besitzen. Wenn du den Zustand Sterbend verlierst, erhältst du den Zustand Verwundet 1 (solltest du bereits den Zustand Verwundet besitzen, steigt dein Zustandswert für Verwundet um 1).</p>\n<h3>Bewusstlos</h3>\n<p>Du schläfst oder wurdest K.O. geschlagen. Du kannst nicht handeln. Du erleidest einen Zustandsmalus von -4 auf RK, Wahrnehmung und Reflexwürfe. Du erhältst die Zustände Blind und Auf dem Falschen Fuß. Wenn du diesen Zustand erlangst, stürzt du zu Boden, erhältst den Zustand Liegend und lässt alle gehaltenen Gegenstände fallen, außer der Effekt besagt anderes oder der SL legt fest, dass du dich in einer Position befindest, in welcher dies nicht geschieht.</p>\n<p><strong>Solltest du infolge des Zustandes Sterbend den Zustand Bewusstlos erhalten haben</strong>, kannst du nicht aufwachen, solange du 0 Trefferpunkte hast. Solltest du auf 1 Trefferpunkt oder mehr geheilt werden, verlierst du die Zustände Bewusstlos und Sterbend und kannst in deinem Zug normal handeln.</p>\n<p><strong>Solltest du Bewusstlos sein und 0 Trefferpunkte besitzen, aber nicht den Zustand Sterbend haben</strong>, kehrst du nach Verstreichen von genügend Zeit auf natürlichem Wege auf 1 Trefferpunkt zurück und erwachst. Der SL bestimmt die Dauer deiner Bewusstlosigkeit (zwischen 10 Minuten und mehreren Stunden). Solltest du während dieser Zeit geheilt werden, verlierst du den Zustand Bewusstlos und kannst in deinem nächsten Zug normal handeln.</p>\n<p><strong>Solltest du Bewusstlos sein und mehr als 1 Trefferpunkt besitzen</strong> - z.B. weil du schläfst oder aufgrund eines Effektes den Zustand Bewusstlos besitzt -, wachst du auf eine der folgenden Weisen auf; dabei verlierst du den Zustand Bewusstlos:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Du erleidest Schaden, sofern dieser dich nicht auf 0 Trefferpunkte reduziert. Sollte der Schaden dich auf 0 Trefferpunkte reduzieren, bleibst du Bewusstlos und erhältst zudem den Zustand Sterbend.</li>\n<li>Du erlangst Heilung (natürliche Heilung durch Ausruhen ausgenommen).</li>\n<li>Jemand nutzt die Handlung Interaktion, um dich wachzurütteln.</li>\n<li>Um dich herum herrscht Lärm - dies weckt dich aber nicht automatisch. Vielmehr kannst du automatisch zu Beginn deines Zuges einen Wahrnehmungswurf gegen den SG des Lärms ablegen (oder den niedrigsten SG, sollte es mehrere Lärmquellen geben); bei Erfolg erwachst du. Sollten Kreaturen um dich herum sich bemühen, leise zu bleiben, so erfolgt dieser Wahrnehmungswurf gegen ihren Heimlichkeits-SG. Manche magischen Effekte lassen dich aber so tief schlafen, dass du diesen Wahrnehmungswurf nicht ablegen kannst.</li>\n<li>Solltest du nur schlafen, bestimmt der SL, dass du normal aufwachst, wenn du ausgeschlafen hast oder etwas deine Ruhe stört.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Verwundet</h3>\n<p>Du bist ernsthaft verletzt. Dieser Zustand hat stets einen Zustandswert. Verlierst du den Zustand Sterbend und besitzt noch nicht den Zustand Verwundet, so erhältst du Verwundet 1. Solltest du den Zustand Sterbend verlieren und den Zustand Verwundet bereits besitzen, so steigt dein Zustandswert für Verwundet um 1. Solltest du den Zustand Verwundet besitzen und dann den Zustand Sterbend erhalten, so steigt dein Zustandswert für Sterbend um deinen Zustandswert für Verwundet.</p>\n<p>Der Zustand Verwundet endet, wenn dir jemand mittels Wunden versorgen Trefferpunkte zurückgibt oder wenn du auf deine maximale Anzahl an Trefferpunkte zurückgebracht wirst und dich 10 Minuten lang ausgeruht hast.</p>\n<h3>Todgeweiht</h3>\n<p>Eine mächtige Kraft hält deine Seele umklammert und ruft dich ins Grab. Todgeweiht besitzt stets einen Zustandswert. Der Zustandswert für Sterbend, bei dem du stirbst, wird um deinen Zustandswert für Todgeweiht reduziert. Sollte dein maximaler Zustandswert für Sterbend auf 0 reduziert werden, stirbst du augenblicklich. Wenn du stirbst, verlierst du den Zustand Todgeweiht. Dein Zustandswert für Todgeweiht sinkt um 1 mit jeder Nacht, die du vollständig ruhen kannst.</p>\n<h2>Tod</h2>\n<p>Nach dem Tod kannst du keine Aktionen mehr durchführen und wirst von Zaubern nicht mehr betroffen, die auf Kreaturen zielen (es sei denn sie zielen explizit auf tote Kreaturen), und du zählst für alle anderen Zwecke als Gegenstand. Wenn du stirbst, werden deine Trefferpunkte auf 0 reduziert, falls du noch über einen positiven Wert verfügt hast. Du kannst nicht auf mehr als 0 Trefferpunkte gebracht werden, solange du tot bist. Es gibt Magie, die Kreaturen ins Leben zurückrufen kann, wie das Ritual @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.kqhPt9344UkcGVYO]{Auferstehung} oder der Zauber @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.IkGYwHRLhkuoGReG]{Tote erwecken}.</p>\n<h2>Heldenhafte Erholung</h2>\n<p>Wenn du mindestens einen Heldenpunkt hast (Seite 467), kannst du zu Beginn deines Zuges oder wenn dein Zustandswert für Sterbend sich erhöhen würde, alle deine verbleibenden Heldenpunkte ausgeben, um dich bei 0 TP zu stabilisieren. Du verlierst den Zustand Sterbend. Wenn du eine heldenhafte Erholung durchführst, erhältst du nicht den Zustand Verwundet (bzw. erhöhst dessen Zustandswert nicht). Ein bereits bestehender Zustandswert für Verwundet bleibt unberührt.</p>\n<h2>Todeseffekte und sofortiger Tod</h2>\n<p>Manche Zauber und Effekte können dich sofort töten oder dich dem Tode näher bringen, ohne dich dafür auf 0 Trefferpunkte reduzieren zu müssen. Diese Fähigkeiten haben die Kategorie Tod und benutzen meistens Leerenenergie, den Inbegriff des Gegenteils von Leben. Wenn du durch einen Todeseffekt auf 0 Trefferpunkte gebracht wirst, bist du auf der Stelle tot, ohne dass du Sterbend 4 erreichen musst. Wenn ein Effekt besagt, dass er dich augenblicklich tötet, stirbst du, ohne dass du Sterbend 4 oder 0 Trefferpunkte erreicht haben musst.</p>\n<h2>Massiver Schaden</h2>\n<p>Du stirbst augenblicklich, wenn du jemals mehr Schaden auf einmal nimmst als das Doppelte deiner maximalen Trefferpunkte.</p>\n<h2>Temporäre Trefferpunkte</h2>\n<p>Manche Zauber oder Fähigkeiten verleihen dir Temporäre Trefferpunkte. Du solltest über diese Trefferpunkte getrennt von deinen aktuellen und maximalen Trefferpunkten Buch führen. Wenn du Schaden nimmst, reduzierst du zuerst deine Temporären Trefferpunkte. Meistens halten Temporäre Trefferpunkte nur eine gewisse Zeit lang vor. Temporäre Trefferpunkte kannst du nicht durch Heilung zurückgewinnen, aber du kannst durch andere Fähigkeiten neue erlangen. Du kannst aber Temporäre Trefferpunkte immer nur aus einer Quelle gleichzeitig haben. Wenn du bereits Temporäre Trefferpunkte besitzt und dann weitere Temporäre Trefferpunkte erlangst, musst du wählen, ob du jene behältst, die du schon hast (mit der dazu gehörigen Wirkungsdauer), oder ob du die neuen Temporären Trefferpunkte mit der entsprechenden Wirkungsdauer erlangst.</p>"

Der Spieler kann einfach einen der verfügbaren Hintergründe auswählen, der das Leben seines Charakters wiederspiegelt, bevor er auf Abenteuer auszog. Obwohl dies eine gute Methode ist, die Hintergrundgeschichte eines Charakters festzulegen, möchten manche Spieler mehr Einblick in das frühere Leben oder die Familie des Charakters erhalten.</p>\n<h2>Umfangreiche Hintergründe benutzen</h2>\n<p>Diese Regelvariante ersetzt Schritt 4 der Charaktererschaffung (GRW, S. 25). Der Spieler würfelt auf den Tabellen in diesem Abschnitt, um den familiären Hintergrund, die Heimat, prägende Kindheitserlebnisse, einflussreiche Wegbegleiter, Beziehungen und Rückschläge für seinen Charakter zu bestimmen. Jedes Element des Hintergrundes des Charakters fügt der Liste der Optionen, die der Hintergrund gewährt, weitere hinzu. Dies können Attributsverbesserungen, Fertigkeiten, Talente und andere Optionen sein. Der Spieler schreibt diese Optionen zunächst bei der Zusammenstellung des Hintergrundes seines Charakters auf, um am Ende dieses Prozesses aus den notierten Optionen folgendes auszuwählen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zwei Attributsverbesserungen - jeweils für unterschiedliche Attribute.</li>\n<li>Eine Kenntnisfertigkeit, in der der Charakter den Kompetenzgrad Geübt erhält.</li>\n<li>Ein Fertigkeitstalent (oder möglicherweise ein anderes Talent oder einen Ausrüstungsgegenstand). Wenn der Spieler ein Fertigkeitstalent auswählt, erhält sein Charakter den Kompetenzgrad Geübt für die Fertigkeit, die das Talent als Voraussetzung hat. Falls das Talent mehrere Fertigkeiten als Voraussetzung hat (wie z.B. @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.IlOQuCQIhjJpig3S]{Schnelles Identifizieren}), erhält er den Kompetenzgrad Geübt nur in einer dieser Fertigkeiten. Falls das zufällige Ergebnis ein Talent einschließt, das kein Fertigkeitstalent ist und der Spieler dieses Talent wählt, erhält er in keiner Fertigkeit den Kompetenzgrad Geübt. Falls er statt des Fertigkeitstalents einen Ausrüstungsgegenstand wählt, ist im entsprechenden Eintrag aufgeführt, in welcher Fertigkeit er den Kompetenzgrad Geübt, wenn überhaupt, erhält.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Neu auswürfeln und auswählen</h3>\n<p>Du kannst entscheiden, ob die Ergebnisse der folgenden Tabellen bindend für die Spieler sein müssen. Abhängig davon, wie deine Gruppe Umfangreiche Hintergründe nutzen möchte, können die Spieler jedes Ergebnis, das ihnen nicht gefällt, neu auswürfeln oder sogar eine bestimmte Option in einer Tabelle auswählen, falls sie zur entstehenden Vision ihrer Charaktergeschichte passt. Dennoch, falls du Spielern erlaubst, neu auszuwürfeln oder eine Option direkt auszuwählen (und eventuell sogar falls du es nicht erlaubst), könntest du Optionen, die andere Talente als Fertigkeitstalente gewähren, verbieten; diese Optionen sind so besonders, dass sie zu verlockend für die Spieler sein könnten, so dass die Spieler am Ende nur diese auswählen. Beachte, dass die folgenden Tabellen für die Kampagnenwelt Golarion gedacht sind, wie sie im Grundregelwerk und in den Kompendien zum Zeitalter der Verlorenen Omen gedacht sind - falls deine Geschichte in einer anderen Kampagnenwelt spielt, kannst du die Tabellen nach Belieben anpassen oder den Spielern erlauben, die Optionen zu wählen, die am besten zu deiner Welt passen.</p>\n<h2>Umfangreiche Hintergründe erschaffen</h2>\n<p>Folge als Spieler den folgenden Schritten, um den Umfangreichen Hintergrund deines Charakters zu erschaffen.</p>"

Weithin können die Zustände @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Verborgen} und @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Unsichtbar} die Sichtbarkeit der Kreatur einschränken, und der Zustand @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.9evPzg9E6muFcoSk]{Unbemerkt} bedeutet, dass du überhaupt nicht weißt, dass die Kreatur anwesend ist.</p>\n<p>Mit Ausnahme von Unsichtbar gelten diese Zustände immer einem Beobachter gegenüber - eine Kreatur kann also dir gegenüber den Zustand Beobachtet haben, aber Versteckt gegenüber deinen Verbündeten. Wenn du versuchst, eine Kreatur als Ziel auszuwählen, die schwierig zu sehen oder anderweitig zu spüren ist, treten verschiedene Nachteile für dich ein. Die meisten dieser Regeln finden für Gegenstände, die du wahrnehmen möchtest, genauso Anwendung wie für Kreaturen.</p>\n<p>Im Normalfall hält der SL nach, wie gut Kreaturen einander wahrnehmen können, da keiner der Beteiligten über alle Informationen verfügt. Z.B. könntest du glauben, eine Kreatur befände sich an dem letzten Ort, an dem du sie ausgemacht hast, allerdings ist sie inzwischen @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{davongeschlichen}. Vielleicht glaubst du auch, eine Kreatur könne dich im Dunklen nicht sehen, aber sie verfügt über Dunkelsicht.</p>\n<p>Du kannst versuchen der Entdeckung zu entgehen, indem du die Fertigkeit Heimlichkeit einsetzt, um @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.IE2nThCmoyhQA0Jn]{Unbemerkt zu bleiben}, dich zu @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{verstecken} oder zu @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{schleichen}, oder indem du Täuschung einsetzt, um für eine @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.GkmbTGfg8KcgynOA]{Ablenkung zu sorgen}.</p>\n<h3>Beobachtet</h3>\n<p>In den meisten Situationen kannst du Kreaturen problemlos spüren und sie ganz normal als Ziel auswählen. In einem solchen Fall haben die Kreaturen den Zustand Beobachtet. Beobachtung erfordert einen Genauen Sinn - für die meisten Kreaturen ist dies Sicht. Beachte aber den Abschnitt @UUID[.jEf21wTIEXzGtPU6]{Wahrnehmung mit anderen Sinnen}, dort findest du Hinweise bezüglich Kreaturen, die andere Sinne als Sicht als ihren Primärsinn benutzen. Wenn du eine Kreatur nicht beobachten kannst, dann hat sie den Zustand Versteckt, Unentdeckt oder Unbemerkt, und du musst dies bei der Zielauswahl berücksichtigen. Selbst wenn eine Kreatur Beobachtet ist, kann sie immer noch den Zustand Verborgen haben.</p>\n<h3>Versteckt</h3>\n<p>Eine Kreatur, die den Zustand Versteckt hat, ist kaum wahrnehmbar. Du weißt, in welchem Feld sich eine Versteckte Kreatur befindet, aber auch nicht mehr. Vielleicht befindet sich die Kreatur nur hinter einer Deckung und hat erfolgreich die Aktion Verstecken genutzt. Dein Ziel könnte sich auch in einer dichten Nebelbank befinden oder hinter einem Wasserfall, wo du ein wenig Bewegung ausmachen kannst, aber keinen exakten Ort. Vielleicht bist du auch @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{blind} oder steht die Kreatur unter der Wirkung von @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.XXqE1eY3w3z6xJCB]{Unsichtbarkeit}, aber hast du sie mit einer Einfachen Aktion @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Suchen} allein mit Einsatz deines Gehörs ausfindig gemacht. Ungeachtet der genauen Umstände hast du gegenüber einer Versteckten Kreatur den Zustand @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Auf dem Falschen Fuß}.</p>\n<p>Wenn du eine Versteckte Kreatur als Ziel auswählst, musst du, bevor du den Effekt bestimmst, einen Einfachen Wurf gegen SG 11 ablegen. Bei einem Fehlschlag kannst du die Kreatur nicht beeinflussen. Die Aktionen, die du benutzt hast, bleiben aber aufgewendet, ebenso alles weitere wie Zauberplätze, Kosten und sonstige Ressourcen. Du behältst den Zustand Auf dem Falschen Fuß gegenüber der Kreatur, egal ob du sie erfolgreich als Ziel auswählen konntest oder nicht.</p>\n<h3>Unentdeckt</h3>\n<p>Wenn eine Kreatur den Zustand Unentdeckt hat, weißt du nicht, wo sie sich befindet. Du erhältst ihr gegenüber den Zustand Auf dem Falschen Fuß und kannst sie nicht ohne weiteres als Ziel auswählen. Du kannst die Einfache Aktion Suchen ausführen, um eine Unentdeckte Kreatur zu finden. Dadurch erhält sie dir gegenüber den Zustand Versteckt statt Unentdeckt. Wenn eine Kreatur Unentdeckt ist, heißt dies nicht, dass du ihrer Gegenwart nicht gewahr bist. Du könntest vermuten, dass sich eine Unentdeckte Kreatur mit dir in einem Raum befindet, auch wenn du nicht in der Lage bist, ausfindig zu machen, in welchem Feld sie sich aufhält. Für Kreaturen, die du gar nicht bemerkt hast, gibt es den Zustand Unbemerkt.</p>\n<p>Es ist schwierig, eine Unentdeckte Kreatur als Ziel auszuwählen. Wenn du vermutest, dass eine Kreatur zugegen ist, könntest du ein Feld auswählen und einen Angriff versuchen. Dies funktioniert genauso wie ein Angriff gegen eine Versteckte Kreatur, aber sowohl der Einfache Wurf als auch der Angriff werden vom SL verdeckt abgelegt. Der SL teilt dir nicht mit, warum du nicht getroffen hast - es könnte daran liegen, dass der Einfache Wurf ein Fehlschlag war, dass der Angriffswurf nicht gut genug war oder dass du das falsche Feld ausgewählt hast. Der SL könnte es dir auch erlauben, eine Unentdeckte Kreatur auf ähnliche Weise als Ziel für einen Zauber oder eine andere Fähigkeit auszuwählen. Effekte mit einem Wirkungsbereich wirken auf Unentdeckte Kreaturen ganz normal.</p>\n<p>Ein Beispiel: Ein feindlicher Elfenmagier wirkt @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.XXqE1eY3w3z6xJCB]{Unsichtbarkeit} und setzt sich dann mittels Schleichen ab. Du vermutest, dass der Elf, dessen Bewegungsrate 30 Fuß/9 m beträgt, sich 15 Fuß/4,50 m weit zu einer offenen Tür hin fortbewegt hat. Du bewegst dich zu einem Feld hin, das 15 Fuß/4,50 m entfernt ist von der Stelle, von der aus der Elf losgegangen ist, und sich auf direktem Weg zur Tür befindet. Dieses Feld greifst du an. Der SL legt verdeckt einen Angriffswurf und einen Einfachen Wurf ab, weiß aber, dass deine Vermutung nicht ganz richtig war, denn der Elf befindet sich im angrenzenden Feld! Der SL teilt dir mit, dass du den Elfen verfehlt hast. Du entscheidest dich, deinen nächsten Angriff sicherheitshalber in das angrenzende Feld auszuführen. Dieses Mal ist es das richtige Feld, und die verdeckten Würfe des SL sind erfolgreich - du triffst!</p>\n<h3>Unbemerkt</h3>\n<p>Wenn du gar keine Vermutung hast, dass eine Kreatur überhaupt anwesend ist, dann besitzt sie dir gegenüber den Zustand Unbemerkt. Dieser Zustand ist hauptsächlich relevant für Fähigkeiten, die nur gegen Ziel angewendet werden können, die deiner Anwesenheit nicht gewahr sind.</p>"

Dies könnte bedeuten, dass ein Opfer in einem mit Geräuschen gefüllten Raum den Zustand @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Verborgen} besitzt oder bei genügend Lärm sogar @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Versteckt} oder @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Unsichtbar} im Wirkungsbereich eines @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.gIdDLrbswTV3OBJy]{Stille}-Zaubers.</p>\n<h3><p>Heimlichkeit und andere Sinne</p></h3>\n<p>Die Fertigkeit Heimlichkeit hat die Anwendungen Verstecken, um Entdeckung durch Sicht zu entgehen, sowie Schleichen, um zu vermeiden, dass man gehört und gesehen wird.

Jemand, der z.B. vorsichtige Schritte macht, um einer Entdeckung durch Erschütterungssinn zu entgehen, verwendet Schleichen.</p>\n<p>Manchmal ergibt es aber auch keinen Sinn, einen auf Geschicklichkeit basierenden Fertigkeitswurf für Heimlichkeit zum Schleichen abzulegen. Wenn ein SC beispielsweise einer Kreatur entgehen will, die den Herzschlag spüren kann, könnte er meditieren, um seinen Pulsschlag zu verlangsamen, sodass er Weisheit statt Geschicklichkeit für den Attributsmodifikator für den Fertigkeitswurf für Heimlichkeit verwendet. Wenn eine Kreatur dich mit mehreren Sinnen entdecken kann, z.B. durch Hören und Sehen, verwendest du den niedrigsten aller anwendbaren Attributsmodifikatoren für deinen Wurf.</p>"

Die folgenden Abschnitte bieten Tipps, wie du passende SG bestimmst und sie gegebenenfalls so angleichst, wie es für deine Geschichte nötig ist. Unter gewissen Umständen funktioniert es gut, einen einfachen SG zu wählen und einen stufenabhängigen SG zu nutzen, welche du beide nach den folgenden Richtlinien in der Schwierigkeit anpasst.</p>\n<h2>Einfache SG</h2>\n<p>Manchmal musst du aus dem Bauch heraus schnell einen Schwierigkeitsgrad bestimmen. Am einfachsten orientierst du dich an Tabelle für Einfache SG, indem du abschätzt, welcher Kompetenzgrad in etwa am ehesten zur fraglichen Aufgabe passt (der Grad ist aber meistens nicht der erforderliche Mindestkompetenzgrad).</p>\n<p>Sollte praktisch jeder eine gute Erfolgschance haben, so nutze den SG für Ungeübt. Sollte ein gewisses Maß an Training erforderlich sein, so nutze den SG für Geübt, Experte, Meister oder Legende, ganz wie es zur Komplexität der Aufgabe am besten passt. Sollte z.B. ein SC sagen, er versuche die wahre Geschichte hinter einer Fabel in Erfahrung zu bringen, so legst du erst einmal fest, dass ein Fertigkeitswurf zum Wissen abrufen nötig ist. Dann entscheidest du, dass der Kompetenzgrad Meister in Folklorewissen nötig ist, um die gesuchte Information zu kennen, daher setzt du den SG auf 30 fest - den einfachen SG für Kompetenzgrad Meister.</p>\n<p>Einfache SG funktionieren am besten, wenn du rasch einen SG benötigst und mit der Aufgabe keine Stufe assoziiert ist. Dies geht am besten mit Fertigkeitswürfen. Da es zwischen den einfachen SG keine großen Abstufungen gibt, funktionieren sie nicht gut bei Gefahren oder Kampfbeteiligten, wo das Leben der SC auf dem Spiel steht. Bei solchen Herausforderungen solltest du lieber stufenbasierende SG verwenden.</p>\n<h2>Stufenbasierende SG</h2>\n<p>Wenn du einen Fertigkeits-SG bestimmst, der auf etwas mit einer Stufe basiert, so nutze Tabelle für stufenbasierte SG, um den SG festzusetzen. Finde die Stufe des Themas des Wurfs und weise den korrespondierenden SG zu. Da Zauber eine Skala von 1-10 nutzen, so verwende die Tabelle für Zauber-SG nach Grad. Nutze diese SG, wenn ein SC einen Zauber identifizieren oder Wissen über eine Kreatur abrufen will oder einen Wurf zum Verdienen von Einkommen mittels einer Aufgabe einer bestimmten Stufe ablegen will usw.. Du kannst auch stufenbasierende SG für Hindernisse nutzen, statt einen einfachen SG zuzuweisen. So könntest du z.B. bestimmen, dass eine Wand in einem hochstufigen Gewölbe aus glattem Metall besteht und entsprechend schwer zu erklettern ist. Du könntest bestimmen, dass man den Kompetenzgrad Meister besitzen muss, um die Wand erklettern zu können, und dann den einfachen SG von 30 verwenden. Oder du könntest bestimmten, dass der böse Gegner der 15. Stufe, der das Gewölbe errichtet hat, auch die Wand gefertigt hat, und den SG für die 15. Stufe von 34 verwenden - beide Ansätze sind perfekt vertretbar.</p>\n<p>Beachte, dass ein SC, der eine Fertigkeit verbessert, wahrscheinlicher bei einem SG seiner Stufe Erfolg hat - und dies während seiner ganzen Karriere, so dass die aufgeführten SG letztendlich für sie sehr einfach werden.</p>\n<h2>Schwierigkeit anpassen</h2>\n<p>Du könntest bestimmen, dass ein SG von den Richtlinien abweichen sollte. Er könnte z.B. gesenkt werden, falls sich ein SC auf dem fraglichen Bereich besonders gut auskennt, oder aber erhöht werden, sollte ein Zauber oder Gegenstand besonders selten sein. Eine Anpassung des SG repräsentiert eine essentielle Differenz bei der Schwierigkeit von Aufgaben und gilt für jeden, der einen spezifischen Wurf für die fragliche Aufgabe ablegt.</p>\n<p>Anpassungen geschehen am ehesten bei Aufgaben, deren SG auf der Stufe basieren. Anpassungen nutzen eine Skala von -10 bis +10 (von Unglaublich einfach bis Unglaublich schwierig) und sind in Schritte von 2, 5 und 10 unterteilt. Du nutzt Anpassungen oft bei Dingen der Seltenheitskategorien Ungewöhnlich, Selten und Einzigartig.</p>\n<p>Die Bezeichnungen dieser Anpassungen besagen nicht, wie schwierig eine Aufgabe tatsächlich für einen SC oder eine Gruppe von SC ist. Anpassungen sollen auch nicht die Boni oder Mali der SC ausgleichen oder ersetzen. Wenn SC ihre Fertigkeiten verbessern, werden sie mit jedem Stufenaufstieg auch darin besser. Beispielsweise hätte der beste SC der 1. Stufe mit einem Unglaublich schwierig SG der 1. Stufe große Probleme und könnte leicht einen Kritischen Fehlschlag erfahren. Ein optimierter Charakter der 20. Stufe kann hingegen mit etwas Magie oder Hilfe meistens Unglaublich schwierige SG der 20. Stufe überwinden und erzielt nur bei einer Natürlichen 1 einen Kritischen Fehlschlag. Auf höheren Stufen werden viele Gruppen feststellen, dass der Sehr schwierige SG für sie eher der Standard ist - daher vergiss dies nicht, wenn du einen SG benötigst, der eine wahre Herausforderung für eine hochstufige Gruppe darstellt.</p>\n<p>Du kannst verschiedene SG für eine Aufgabe in Abhängigkeit vom gewählten Ansatz der SC nutzen - manche Methoden oder Fertigkeiten sind einfach erfolgversprechender als andere. Nehmen wir an, die SC finden ein magisches Buch über aberrante Kreaturen. Das Buch ist ein Gegenstand der 4. Stufe und besitzt die Kategorie Okkult, daher bestimmst du den SG eines Fertigkeitswurfs für Okkultismus zum Identifizieren der Magie gemäß der Tabelle für SG nach Stufe auf 19. Andere Fertigkeiten mit Magiebezug können meistens mit einem höheren SG genutzt werden, daher könntest du für die Nutzung von Arkane Künste festsetzen, dass der SG Sehr schwierig ist und ihn auf 24 festlegen. Sollte ein Charakter in deiner Gruppe über die Kenntnis Aberrationenkunde (oder ähnliches) verfügen, könntest du bestimmen, dass der Wurf für ihn Einfach oder Sehr einfach ist und SG 17 oder 14 nutzt. Diese Anpassungen ersetzen nicht die Boni, Mali und anderen Modifikatoren der Charaktere - sie resultieren aus der Wahl der genutzten Methoden.</p>\n<h3>Gruppenbemühungen</h3>\n<p>Die SG in diesem Kapitel verschaffen einem individuellen Charakter eine starke und wachsende Erfolgschance, sowie sie einen Kompetenzgrad besitzen. Zuweilen gibt es aber Aufgaben, bei denen nur ein SC der Gruppe Erfolg haben muss, die aber von allen angegangen werden können. Die Anzahl der genutzten Würfel bedeutet im Grunde, dass mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit wenigstens ein Wurf gelingt. Meistens ist das völlig in Ordnung, doch zuweilen soll die Aufgabe trotzdem herausfordernd und die Erfolgschance ungewiss bleiben. In diesen Fällen mache den Wurf Sehr schwierig oder Unglaublich schwierig, wenn er auf hohen Stufen besonders hart sein soll. Bei diesen SG werden die meisten Gruppenmitglieder wahrscheinlich scheitern, wobei dennoch einem SC schließlich der Erfolg beschieden sein wird - eben jenem Charakter, der am meisten in die fragliche Fertigkeit investiert hat, wie es von einem Spezialisten auch zu erwarten wäre.</p>\n<h2>Mindestkompetenzgrad</h2>\n<p>Manchmal ist bei einer Aufgabe neben einem erfolgreichen Fertigkeitswurf auch ein bestimmter Mindestkompetenzgrad erforderlich. Schlösser und Fallen benötigen oftmals einen Mindestkompetenzgrad, um mittels Diebeskunst ein Schloss zu knacken oder einen Mechanismus auszuschalten. Natürlich kann ein Charakter, dessen Kompetenzgrad nicht genügt, den Wurf versuchen - aber seine Erfolgschance ist 0. Dir steht es frei, ähnliche Minimalkompetenzgrade auch anderen Aufgaben zuzuweisen. Du könntest z.B. entscheiden, dass eine bestimmte arkane Theorie einen gewissen Kompetenzgrad in Arkane Künste voraussetzt, um sie zu verstehen. Ein Barbar mit dem Kompetenzgrad Ungeübt in Arkane Künste kann den Wurf nicht schaffen, natürlich aber trotzdem versuchen - andernfalls könnte er ja nicht möglicherweise einen Kritischen Fehlschlag erzielen und völlig falsche Informationen erlangen.</p>\n<p>Beachte die folgenden Richtlinien bei Würfen, die einen Mindestkompetenzgrad erfordern: Eine Aufgabe der 2. Stufe oder weniger sollte nahezu niemals den Kompetenzgrad Experte erfordern, eine Aufgabe der 6. Stufe oder weniger sollte nahezu niemals den Kompetenzgrad Meister erfordern und eine Aufgabe der 14. Stufe oder weniger sollte nahezu niemals den Kompetenzgrad Legende voraussetzen - schließlich hätte kein Charakter der fraglichen Stufe eine Chance auf Erfolg.</p>"

Du kannst Anleitungen für gewöhnlich lesen, solange du der Sprache mächtig bist, in der sie verfasst sind, selbst wenn dir die Fähigkeit fehlt, den Gegenstand zu fertigen. Alchemisten und Handwerksgilden nutzen oft obskure Geheimsprachen oder entwerfen Geheimschriften, um ihre Geheimnisse vor der Konkurrenz zu schützen. Du kannst gewöhnliche Anleitungen für den in der obigen Tabelle genannten Preis kaufen oder einen NSC bezahlen, der dir zum selben Preis eine Abschrift anfertigt. Eine gekaufte Anleitung ist normalerweise auf einer zusammengerollten leichten Pergamentrolle niedergeschrieben. Mit 1 Stunde Zeitaufwand kannst du die Anleitung von einer solchen Schriftrolle oder aus einem anderen Formelbuch in dein Formelbuch übertragen. Wenn du im Besitz der passenden Anleitung bist, kannst du den entsprechenden Gegenstand herstellen. Anleitungen für ungewöhnliche oder seltene Gegenstände kosten für gewöhnlich bedeutend mehr, wenn du sie überhaupt finden kannst. Wenn du einen Gegenstand besitzt, kannst du versuchen, die dazugehörige Anleitung herauszufinden. Dazu benutzt du ebenfalls die Fertigkeit Handwerkskunst und benötigst genau so lange, wie es dauern würde, einen Gegenstand nach Anleitung herzustellen. Zuerst musst du den Gegenstand zerlegen. Nach der Standard-Auszeit legst du einen Fertigkeitswurf für Handwerkskunst ab, gegen denselben SG, den die Herstellung des Gegenstandes hätte. Wenn du Erfolg hast, kannst du die Anleitung zu ihrem vollen Preis herstellen, du kannst wie gewöhnlich weiterarbeiten, um den Preis zu reduzieren. Wenn dein Fertigkeitswurf misslingt, hast du einen Haufen Rohstoffe und keine Anleitung. Bei einem Kritischen Fehlschlag ruinierst du auch noch 10% der Rohstoffe, welche du normalerweise zurückbehalten würdest. Die Einzelteile eines Gegenstandes sind als Rohstoffe die Hälfte des gesamten Gegenstandes wert. Der Gegenstand kann nicht wieder zusammengesetzt werden, bis du erfolgreich die Anleitung herausfindest oder anderweitig an sie gelangst. Einen Gegenstand mit Hilfe einer Anleitung wieder zusammenzusetzen, funktioniert genau so, wie ihn neu herzustellen, die alten Einzelteile dienen dir dabei als Rohstoffe.</p>"

Diese können dir Glück verleihen oder helfen, dem Tod von der Schippe zu springen. Im Gegensatz zu den meisten Aspekten deines Charakters, die über lange Zeit hinweg bleiben, halten Heldenpunkte nur eine Spielsitzung lang vor.</p>\n<p>Es obliegt dem SL, die Spieler mit Heldenpunkten zu belohnen - Richtlinien dafür findest du auf Seite 507 (GRW). Normalerweise bekommt jeder Charakter zu Beginn einer Spielsitzung 1 Heldenpunkt. Im Verlauf der Sitzung kann er weitere hinzugewinnen, indem er Heldentaten vollbringt - besonders selbstlose, mutige Handlungen oder Dinge, die die normalen Erwartungen übersteigen.

Wenn du diesen Zustand aber bereits hast, verlierst du ihn nicht und reduzierst auch nicht seinen Wert.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Heldentaten beschreiben</h2>\n<p>Heldenpunkte repräsentieren heldenhafte Taten oder Leistungen jenseits normaler Erwartung. Wenn du also einen Heldenpunkt ausgibst, solltest du auch die Heldentat oder Leistung, die dein Charakter damit vollbringt, für deine Mitspieler beschreiben.</p>\n<p>Die Taten deines Charakters könnten auf eine in der Vergangenheit gelernte Lektion zurückgehen. Vielleicht könnte er auch von Entschlossenheit angetrieben werden, jemanden zu retten, oder hängt das Geschehen auch von einem Gegenstand ab, in dessen Besitz dein Charakter bei einem früheren Abenteuer gelangt ist. Wenn du deine Heldentat nicht beschreiben möchtest oder dir nichts Passendes einfällt, kannst du den SL bitten, sich etwas Entsprechendes auszudenken. Dies kann auch in Zusammenarbeit geschehen. Vielleicht kann dich der SL an ein längst vergessenes Ereignis in der Kampagne erinnern, und du musst nur noch dazu beitragen, wie dir dieses Ereignis gerade im richtigen Moment in den Sinn kommt und dich motiviert, deine Grenzen zu überwinden.</p>\n<h2>Heldenpunkte (Belohnungen)</h2>\n<p>Im Gegensatz zu Erfahrungspunkten und Schätzen werden Heldenpunkte jede Spielsitzung neu ausgegeben und verbraucht, statt angehäuft. Zu Beginn einer Spielsitzung gibst du 1 Heldenpunkt an jeden Spielercharakter aus. Ebenso kannst du weitere Heldenpunkte während des Spieles vergeben - dies geschieht in der Regel nach einem heldenhaften Augenblick oder Erzielen einer heroischen Errungenschaft (siehe unten). Wie auf Seite 467 vermerkt, kann ein Spieler einen Heldenpunkt nutzen, um einen Wurf zu wiederholen, oder alle Heldenpunkte, um sich zu erholen, sollte er dem Tode nahe gewesen sein. Während einer typischen Spielsitzung gibst du an einen SC üblicherweise 1 Heldenpunkt pro Stunde aus - d.h. im Verlauf einer 4stündigen Sitzung erhält jeder SC den Ausgangsheldenpunkt und 3 weitere Heldenpunkte. Sollte die Gruppe angesichts gewaltiger Widernisse große Tapferkeit zeigen oder du gewollt überschwänglich spielen willst, kannst du die Heldenpunkte auch schneller austeilen, z.B. 1 alle 30 Minuten. Sorge möglichst dafür, dass jeder SC Gelegenheiten erhält, um Heldenpunkte zu verdienen. Und vermeide es, alle Heldenpunkte einem einzelnen Charakter zukommen zu lassen.</p>\n<p>Ein tapferes letztes Gefecht, das Beschützen von Unschuldigen und der Einsatz kluger Strategien oder Zauber, um eine Situation doch noch zu retten, können alle einem Charakter einen Heldenpunkt einbringen. Warte auf jenen Moment, wenn deine Mitspieler feiern oder staunen, was ein Charakter vollbringt - dann ist dein Augenblick gekommen, dem fraglichen Charakter einen Heldenpunkt zukommen zu lassen.</p>\n<p>Die Gruppe kann zudem Heldenpunkte für ihre Errungenschaften im Verlauf des Spiels verdienen. Durchschnittliche und wichtige Errungenschaften könnten ihnen Heldenpunkte einbringen - der fragliche Heldenpunkt geht meistens an den SC, der den wichtigsten Beitrag zum Erreichen einer Errungenschaft beigetragen hat.</p>\n<h2>Heldenpunkte (Spielleiten)</h2>\n<p>Seite 507 des <em>Grundregelwerks</em> bietet Leitlinien dafür, wann und in welchem Umfang Heldenpunkte verliehen werden. Diese Empfehlungen sind flexibel. Betrachte Heldenpunkte als eine Möglichkeit, deinen persönlichen Spielleiterstil zu unterstützen und das zu belohnen, was du im Spiel wertschätzt. Das Schwierigste beim Belohnen mit Heldenpunkten ist, daran zu denken! Ein vor dir liegender Erinnerungszettel für die Heldenpunkte kann wie ein optischer und greifbarer Knoten im Taschentuch wirken. Du kannst auch deine Spieler um ihre Unterstützung bitten, indem sie dich darauf hinzuweisen, wenn aus ihrer Sicht eine SC-Aktion einen Heldenpunkt verdient.</p>"

Die Tabelle hat einzelne Einträge für dünne Gegenstände (wie Schilde), gewöhnliche Gegenstände (wie Rüstungen), und verstärkte oder besonders stabile Bauwerke (wie Mauern).</p>\n<p>Stein ist ein Sammelbegriff für alle harten Gesteine wie Granit und Marmor. Ebenso deckt Holz alle gewöhnlichen Holzsorten wie Eiche oder Kiefer ab. Bei Metallwaffen und -rüstungen wird davon ausgegangen, dass sie, sofern nicht anderweitig vermerkt, aus Eisen oder Stahl bestehen.</p>\n<p>Wenn ein Gegenstand aus mehr als einem Material besteht, verwendet der SL normalerweise die Spielwerte für das stärkste Material. Wenn beispielsweise eine Wand aus mit Papier bespannten, geflochtenen Holzrahmen aufgebrochen wird, muss dafür der Schaden für dünnes Holz berechnet werden, nicht der für Papier. Eventuell wird der SL jedoch auch das schwächere Material wählen, abhängig von der Funktion des Gegenstands. Beispielsweise wird ein Hammer auch dann unbenutzbar, wenn man anstelle des eisernen Kopfes seinen hölzernen Griff zerbricht. Manchmal ist ein Gegenstand sogar weniger robust als die für einen dünnen Gegenstand vorgesehene Härte oder seine Trefferpunkte implizieren; zum Beispiel müssen einem Zweig keine 9 Schadenspunkte zugefügt werden, bevor dieser bricht, obwohl er aus dünnem Holz besteht. Gleichermaßen kann ein besonders stabiler Gegenstand oder ein solches Bauwerk sogar höhere Härte- und Trefferpunktwerte aufweisen. Bestimmte Bauwerke, insbesondere dicke Mauern, sind derart verstärkt, dass du sie nur über einen längeren Zeitraum hinweg und mithilfe von Werkzeugen niederreißen kannst.

Für manche Erzählungen jedoch passt dieser Handlungsbogen nicht. In jenen Geschichten geht es darum, in einer gnadenlosen und unberechenbaren Welt auf Nummer sicher zu gehen, während nicht einmal der beste Kämpfer der Welt einen Sieg über eine große Gruppe nur moderat fähiger Banditen garantieren kann. In Spielen wie diesen könnte deine Gruppe in Erwägung ziehen, die Charakterstufe vom Kompetenzbonus zu entfernen.</p>\n<p>Die Umsetzung ist recht simpel: der Kompetenzbonus beträgt nun lediglich +2 für Geübt, +4 für Experte, +6 für Meister und +8 für Legendär. Wir empfehlen außerdem, einem Charakter mit Kompetenzgrad Ungeübt einen Kompetenzmodifikator von - 2 anstatt eines Kompetenzbonus von +0 zu geben. Darüber hinaus reduzierst du für Kreaturen, Gefahren, Magische Gegenstände usw. jeden Spielwert, der einen Kompetenzbonus beinhaltet, um die Stufe der Kreatur oder des entsprechenden Regelelements. Diese Spielwerte sind für gewöhnlich Modifikatoren und SG für Angriffe, RK, Rettungswürfe, Wahrnehmung, Fertigkeiten und Zauber.</p>\n<p>Zuletzt verringerst du die Fertigkeits-SG für die meisten Aufgaben, um der Entfernung der Stufe Rechnung zu tragen. Du kannst einfach die Stufe von den @UUID[.dRu66xNqJ9Ihe1or]{SG-Tabellen} abziehen oder du schaust in der obigen Tabelle: Einfache Fertigkeits-SG (Ohne Stufe), um eine Liste von SG zu haben, die leichter zu merken ist. Die neuen SG machen es hochstufigen Charakteren entsprechend der oben beschriebenen Thematik etwas schwerer, bei einem Fertigkeitswurf Erfolg zu haben, als es mit den gewohnten Zahlen aus dem <em>Grundregelwerk</em> war. Der Ausgang von Kämpfen tendiert dazu, weniger drastisch zu sein, da Kritische Erfolge und Kritische Fehlschläge unwahrscheinlicher werden. Insbesondere betrifft dies Zauber, denn hier kommen die extremen Effekte durch Kritische Fehlschläge bei Rettungswürfen seltener vor.</p>\n<h3>Begegnungen anpassen</h3>\n<p>Geschichten, in den denen eine große Gruppe niedrigstufiger Monster noch immer eine echte Gefahr für hochstufige SC darstellen (und im umgekehrten Fall ein einzelnes hochstufiges Monster keine so große Bedrohung für eine Gruppe von SC ist), benötigen wesentliche Anpassungen beim Bau von Begegnungen. Dies umfasst auch die Belohnung der SC.</p>\n<p>Die Mathematik im <em>Grundregelwerk</em> sieht vor, dass zwei Monster einer bestimmten Stufe ungefähr so herausfordernd sind wie ein einzelnes Monster 2 Stufen höher. Diese Rechnung geht jedoch nicht mehr auf, nachdem die Stufen vom Kompetenzbonus entfernt wurden. Das EP-Budget für Kreaturen nutzt eine andere Skalierung, wie in Tabelle: EP für Kreaturen (Ohne Stufe) angegeben. Du nutzt für eine Bedrohung immer noch das gleiche EP-Budget wie in @UUID[.9hfEG4kJmEbrjGS1]{Begegnungen erstellen und EP-Belohnungen} angegeben (80 EP für eine Begegnung mit Bedrohungsgrad Durchschnittlich, 120 für eine mit Bedrohungsgrad Ernsthaft und so weiter).</p>\n<p>Obwohl die EP-Werte in Tabelle in den meisten Fällen gut passen, bilden sie manchmal nicht gut die Effekte der besonderen Fähigkeiten einer Kreatur ab, die einer Gruppe mit deutlich niedrigerer Stufe begegnet. Beispielsweise könnte ein Geisterhafter Magier mit Körperlosigkeit, Fliegen und seinen hochstufigen Zaubern zu viel für eine Gruppe SC der 5. Stufe sein, selbst wenn er in der Unterzahl ist.</p>\n<h3>Schätze anpassen</h3>\n<p>Schätze und die Preise von Gegenständen im <em>Grundregelwerk</em> sind dafür entworfen, es so einfach wie möglich zu machen, Begegnungen zu basteln. Egal ob Kreaturen Gegenstände mit sich tragen oder nicht, man muss sich keine Sorgen darüber machen, ob man zu viel oder zu wenig Schätze verteilt. Dennoch kann es bei dieser Variante passieren, dass die SC eine Kreatur besiegen, die 5 Stufen oder mehr über ihnen ist. Zu viele Begegnungen mit hochstufigen Feinden können dazu führen, dass die SC mehr Schätze erhalten, als du vorgesehen hast, und im Gegenzug kann es passieren, dass die SC es sehr schwer haben, schwächere Feinde zu besiegen, aber trotzdem wenig Schätze erhalten. Du kannst dies in die richtige Richtung bewegen, indem du regelmäßige Anpassungen vornimmst, falls das Vermögen der SC zu weit von der Erwartung abweicht. Indem du den SC weniger Gelegenheiten zum Kauf oder Verkauf magischer Gegenstände gibst, erschwerst du es ihnen, zu viel erhaltene Schätze auszunutzen. Um die Ökonomie des Schätzesystems komplett zu umgehen, kannst du die Regelvariante @UUID[.SnSGU7DPiogZ9JOr]{Automatische Bonusentwicklung für Gegenstände} nutzen.</p>"

          "text": "<p>Auf welche Weise eine Kreatur Wahrnehmung einsetzen kann, hängt davon ab, über welche Sinne sie verfügt. Die wichtigsten Konzepte, die du dafür kennen musst, sind Genaue Sinne, Ungenaue Sinne und die drei Zustände der Wahrnehmung, die ein Ziel dir gegenüber haben kann: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Beobachtet}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Versteckt} oder @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Unentdeckt}. Sicht, Gehör und Geruchssinn sind die drei wichtigsten Sinne, sie haben aber nicht den gleichen Grad an Genauigkeit.</p>\n<h2>Genaue Sinne</h2>\n<p>Normale Sicht ist ein Genauer Sinn - ein Sinn, der benutzt werden kann, um die Welt im kleinsten Detail wahrzunehmen. Die einzige Methode, eine Kreatur ohne Einschränkungen als Ziel auswählen zu können, ist ein Genauer Sinn. Mit einem Genauen Sinn kannst du eine Kreatur normalerweise automatisch entdecken, sofern sie sich nicht versteckt oder durch die Umgebung verborgen ist. In solchen Fällen musst du die Einfache Aktion @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Suchen} einsetzen, um die Kreatur entdecken zu können.</p>\n<h2>Ungenaue Sinne</h2>\n<p>Das Gehör ist ein Ungenauer Sinn - es kann nicht die gleiche Menge an Details erkennen wie ein Genauer Sinn. Mit einem Ungenauen Sinn kannst du eine Kreatur im Normalfall spüren, sie erhält dir gegenüber allerdings den Zustand @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Versteckt} anstelle von @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Beobachtet}. Möglicherweise hat die Kreatur aber auch den Zustand @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Unentdeckt}, wenn sie Heimlichkeit einsetzt oder sich in einer Umgebung befindet, die deinen Sinn stört (bei Gehör z.B. in einem lauten Raum). In solchen Fällen musst du die Einfache Aktion @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Suchen} einsetzen, um die Kreatur entdecken zu können. Im besten Fall kann ein Ungenauer Sinn den Zustand eine Kreatur dir gegenüber von Unentdeckt auf Versteckt verbessern, nicht jedoch auf Beobachtet.</p>\n<h2>Vage Sinne</h2>\n<p>Charaktere haben weiterhin auch viele vage Sinne. Diese Sinne können dich vielleicht darauf hinweisen, dass da irgendetwas ist, sind aber nicht dafür geeignet, es ausfindig zu machen oder genau festzustellen, um was es sich handelt. Der für einen normalen Charakter nützlichste dieser Sinne ist der Geruchssinn. Im besten Fall kann ein Vager Sinn dafür benutzt werden, die Gegenwart einer @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.9evPzg9E6muFcoSk]{Unbemerkten} Kreatur festzustellen, sodass sie dann nur noch @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Unentdeckt} ist. Selbst dann, ist ein Vager Sinn nicht ausreichend, um den Zustand der Kreatur dir gegenüber auf @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Versteckt} oder @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Beobachtet} zu verbessern.</p>\n<p>Wenn eine Kreatur eine andere bemerken kann, verwendet der SL immer den genauesten Sinn, der zur Verfügung steht.</p>\n<p>Die Regeln von Pathfinder gehen davon aus, dass die meisten Kreaturen über Sicht als ihren einzigen Genauen Sinn verfügen und über Gehör als Ungenauen Sinn. Manche Charaktere oder Kreaturen haben jedoch auch Genaue oder Ungenaue Sinne, die dieser Annahme nicht entsprechen. Ein Charakter mit schlechter Sicht könnte diesen Sinn als Ungenau behandeln und ein Tier mit der Fähigkeit Geruchssinn kann diesen Sinn als Ungenauen Sinn behandeln. Eine Kreatur mit Echoortung oder einer ähnlichen Fähigkeit kann Gehör als Genauen Sinn behandeln. Solche Sinne erhalten meistens spezielle Namen und werden als „Echoortung (Genau)“, „Geruchssinn (Ungenau) 30 Fuß/9 m“ oder ähnlich angegeben.</p>\n<h1>Besondere Sinne</h1>\n<p>Während ein Mensch es schwer hat, Kreaturen in Dämmerlicht auszumachen, kann ein Elf diese Kreaturen bestens erkennen. Und während Elfen kein Problem damit haben, bei Mondlicht zu sehen, kann ihre Sicht Dunkelheit nicht durchdringen - ganz im Gegensatz zu der eines Zwergs.</p>\n<p>Besondere Sinne verleihen erweiterte Aufmerksamkeit, die es Kreaturen mit solchen Sinnen ermöglicht, die Auswirkung von Zuständen wie @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Unentdeckt}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Versteckt} oder @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Verborgen} zu ignorieren oder zu reduzieren, wenn es um Situationen geht, bei denen normale Sicht versagt. Im Folgenden sind einige Beispiele für solche besonderen Sinne beschrieben:</p>\n<h2>Dunkelsicht und Mächtige Dunkelsicht</h2>\n<p>Kreaturen mit Dunkelsicht oder Mächtiger Dunkelsicht können in Bereichen mit Dunkelheit oder Dämmerlicht perfekt sehen, wenngleich diese Sicht auch nur in Schwarz-Weiß ist. Bestimmte Arten magischer Dunkelheit, wie z.B. solche, die durch den Zauber @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4GE2ZdODgIQtg51c]{Dunkelheit} auf dem 4. Grad erzeugt wird, blockieren normale Dunkelsicht. Eine Kreatur mit Mächtiger Dunkelsicht kann jedoch auch eine solche magische Dunkelheit durchdringen.</p>\n<h2>Dämmersicht</h2>\n<p>Kreaturen mit Dämmersicht können bei Dämmerlicht genauso gut sehen wie bei Hellem Licht. Sie können daher den Zustand @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Verborgen} ignorieren, wenn er durch Dämmerlicht bedingt ist.</p>\n<h2>Geruchssinn</h2>\n<p>Der Geruchssinn beinhaltet, Kreaturen aufgrund ihres Geruchs aufzuspüren, und ist im Normalfall ein Vager Sinn. Die Reichweite wird bei der Fähigkeit angegeben und kann nur eingesetzt werden, um Kreaturen zu spüren, die auch ein Aroma verbreiten. (Körperlose Kreaturen z.B. verbreiten kein Aroma.)</p>\n<p>Bei Kreaturen, die ein starkes Aroma verbreiten oder aus deren Richtung der Wind weht, kann der SL festlegen, dass sich die Reichweite des Geruchssinns verdoppelt oder gar verdreifacht. Ebenso kann der SL die Reichweite verringern, wenn eine Kreatur sich windabgewandt befindet.</p>\n<h2>Erschütterungssinn</h2>\n<p>Erschütterungssinn erlaubt es Kreaturen, Schwingungen, die durch Bewegung verursacht werden, durch feste Materie hindurch zu spüren. Dies ist normalerweise ein Ungenauer Sinn mit begrenzter Reichweite (die in der Fähigkeit angegeben wird). Der Erschütterungssinn funktioniert nur, wenn sich die spürende Kreatur auf der gleichen Oberfläche befindet wie das Ziel - und auch dann nur, wenn dieses sich entlang der Oberfläche bewegt (oder sich durch sie hindurchgräbt).</p>"

Doktrinen einer Religion</p>\n<h3>Für Wissen abrufen genutzte Fertigkeiten</h3>\n<p>Die folgenden Fertigkeiten können zum Wissen abrufen genutzt werden, um zu den aufgeführten Themen Informationen zu erlangen. In manchen Fällen kann dir der SL gestatten, eine andere Fertigkeit zu nutzen, die bei dem fraglichen Thema möglich wäre, allerdings erhöht dies meistens den SG. Manche Themen erscheinen bei mehreren Fertigkeiten, allerdings könnten die Fertigkeiten unterschiedliche Informationen liefern. Arkane Künste könnte dich über die magischen Verteidigungen eines Golems informieren, während Handwerkskunst Informationen zu seiner Resistenz gegen physische Angriffe liefert.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arkane Künste: Arkane Theorien, magische Traditionen, Kreaturen von arkaner Bedeutung und arkane Existenzebenen</li>\n<li>Gesellschaftskunde: Lokale Geschichte, Gesetzesinstitutionen, wichtige Persönlichkeiten, Gesellschaftsstrukturen und humanoide Kultur</li>\n<li>Handwerkskunst: Alchemistische Reaktionen und Kreaturen, Wert von Gegenständen, Baukunst, Ingenieurswesen, ungewöhnliche Materialien und Konstrukte</li>\n<li>Heilkunde: Gift, Krankheiten, Wunden und Forensik</li>\n<li>Kenntnis: Das Thema der Spezialisierung</li>\n<li>Naturkunde: Die Umgebung, Pflanzen, Kreaturen natürlichen Ursprunges, Geographie, Wetter und Existenzebenen der Natur</li>\n<li>Okkultismus: Uralte Mysterien, obskure Philosophie, Kreaturen von okkulter Bedeutung und esoterische Existenzebenen</li>\n<li>Religionskunde: Göttliche Boten und Diener, Theologie, obskure Mythen, Kreaturen von religiöser Bedeutung und göttliche Existenzebenen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wenn du eine passende Kenntnis für einen Wurf zum Wissen abrufen zu einem Thema nutzt - z.B. Kenntnis (Ingenieurskunst) anstelle von Handwerk, um strukturelle Schwächen bei einer Brücke zu entdecken, ist der SG meistens niedriger. Deine besonderen Interessen können sich auszahlen! In manchen Fällen kann der SL die Nutzung einer anderen, aber verwandten Fertigkeit gestatten, wobei der SG dann wahrscheinlich höher als normal ausfällt. Der SL kann auch Würfe für andere Fertigkeiten zum Wissen abrufen erlauben, z.B. könntest du die Fähigkeiten eines Akrobaten mittels Akrobatik einschätzen. Solltest du (wie im Beispiel) eine körperliche Fertigkeit nutzen, wird der SL wahrscheinlich anstelle des körperlichen Attributsmodifikators einen mentalen Attributsmodifikator verlangen - in der Regel den Intelligenzmodifikator.</p>\n<h3>Mögliche Fragen für Wissen abrufen</h3>\n<p>Wenn dir etwas zum ersten Mal begegnet wird deine erste Frage vermutlich sein „Was ist das?“. Dies kann der SL mit einem Namen und einer einfachen Beschreibung beantworten, wie etwa „Das ist ein Oger, ein kräftiger, brutaler Riese“, oder „Das ist ein Symbol von Urgathoa, einer Gottheit von Krankheit, Verfressenheit und Untod“. Wenn dir diese grundlegenden Informationen bereits bekannt sind, findest du im Folgenden einige Beispiele für mögliche weiterführende Fragen. Der SL legt fest, welche Fragen beantwortet werden. Dieses Vorgehen bleibt für gewöhnlich recht einfach, so lange du deine Fragen auf Dinge beschränkst, die in der Spielwelt wahrnehmbar sind, statt dich nach exakten Zahlen und Mechaniken zu erkundigen. So könnte der SL dir beispielsweise mitteilen, dass ein Reflexwurf der schwächste Rettungswurf des Ogers ist, dies sorgt nur dafür Dinge, die dein Charakter wissen kann, für ein besseres Verständnis in Regelbegriffe zu fassen. Gleichzeitig kann der SL sich aber entscheiden dir nicht den genauen Reflexmodifikator des Ogers zu nennen. Der SL kann in Kern SL ab S.54 mehr Hilfestellungen zu diesem Thema finden.</p>\n<p><strong>Kreaturen:</strong> „Kann man sich mit der Kreatur unterhalten?“ „In welcher Umgebung lebt sie für gewöhnlich?“, „Was ist ihre offensichtlichste Angriffsfähigkeit?“, „Ist sie gegen irgendetwas besonders empfindlich oder resistent?“, „Hat sie irgendwelche Schwachstellen in ihrer Verteidigung?“</p>\n<p><strong>Magie:</strong> „Wie kann diese Magie umgangen werden?“, „Wer benutzt solche Magie für gewöhnlich?“, „Wie lange hält diese Magie an?“</p>\n<p><strong>Organisationen:</strong> „Welchen Einfluss hat diese Organisation?“, „Wo befindet sich das Hauptquartier?“, „Wie groß ist die Organisation?“, „Welche Art Mitglieder hat sie?“, „Was sind ihre wichtigsten Einrichtungen oder Persönlichkeiten?“, „Hat sie bekannte Verbündete oder Feinde?“</p>\n<p><strong>Personen:</strong> „Welche Persönlichkeitsmerkmale hat diese Person?“, „Wie sieht die Person aus?“, „Besitzt diese Person irgendwelche herausstechenden Fähigkeiten?“, „Hat diese Person irgendwelche bekannten Feinde oder Verbündeten?“, „Welche Art Einfluss hat diese Person?“, „Hat diese Person irgendwelche Laster?“</p>\n<p><strong>Örtlichkeiten:</strong> „Wo in etwa liegt dieser Ort?“, „Wie groß ist dieser Ort?“, „Welche Anführer oder Regierung gibt es dort?“, „Wohnen dort irgendwelche besonders wichtigen Personen?“, „Welche Monster gibt es dort?“, „Welche Umgebung und welches Gelände gibt es dort?“</p>"

Wie in der Einfachen Aktion @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.PM5jvValFkbFH3TV]{Aufsitzen} erklärt, muss dein Reittier mindestens eine Größenkategorie größer sein als du und bereit dich zu tragen. Dein Reittier handelt bei deiner Initiative. Du musst die Aktion @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe]{Tier anweisen} benutzen, um dein Reittier dazu zu bringen, seine Aktionen aufzuwenden. Wenn du dies nicht tust, verfallen die Aktionen des Tiers. Wenn du das Allgemeine Talent @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Rq5wkA8DtsmbzoGV]{Reiten} besitzt, hast du automatisch Erfolg, wenn du ein Tier anweist, bei dem es sich um dein Reittier handelt.</p>\n<p>Beispiel: Wenn du auf einem Pferd sitzt und drei Angriffe ausführst, bleibt dein Pferd stehen, weil du es nicht angewiesen hast. Wenn du stattdessen deine erste Aktion mit Erfolg zum Tier anweisen aufwendest, kannst du dein Reittier zum Laufen bringen. Du könntest deine nächste Aktion aufwenden, um anzugreifen oder um das Pferd zum Angriff anzuweisen, aber nicht beides.</p>\n<h3>Berittene Angriffe</h3>\n<p>Du und dein Reittier kämpfen als eine Einheit. Demzufolge teilst du dir deinen Malus für mehrfache Angriffe mit dem Reittier. Wenn du also beispielsweise einen Angriff ausführst und anschließend das Tier anweist einen Angriff auszuführen, so unterliegt der Angriff deines Reittiers dem Malus für mehrfache Angriffe in Höhe von -5.</p>\n<p>Zur Bestimmung von Angriffen nimmst du alle Felder der Angriffsfläche deines Reittiers ein. Wenn du Mittelgroß bist, und dein Reittier Groß, dann kannst du zuerst eine Kreatur auf der einen Seite deines Reittiers angreifen und dann mit deiner nächsten Aktion eine Kreatur auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite. Wenn du einen größeren Angriffsradius hast, hängt die Entfernung teilweise von der Größe deines Reittiers ab. Auf einem Mittelgroßen oder kleineren Reittier benutzt du deinen normalen Angriffsradius. Auf einem Großen oder Riesigen Reittier kannst du alle an das Reittier angrenzenden Felder angreifen, wenn du 5 Fuß/1,50 m oder 10 Fuß/3 m Angriffsradius hast, bzw. alle Felder innerhalb von 10 Fuß/3 m von dem Reittier (auch diagonal), wenn du über 15 Fuß/4,50 m Angriffsradius verfügst.</p>\n<h3>Berittene Verteidigung</h3>\n<p>Wenn du beritten bist, können Angreifer entweder dich oder dein Reittier als Ziel auswählen. Effekte, die mehrere Kreaturen betreffen können (z.B. Flächeneffekte) betreffen euch beide, sofern ihr euch beide im Wirkungsbereich befindet. Du befindest dich im Angriffsradius oder in der Reichweite eines Angreifers, sofern ein Feld der Angriffsfläche deines Reittieres sich darin befindet. Da dein Reittier größer ist als du und du seine Angriffsfläche mit ihm teilst, hast du Schwache Deckung gegen Angriffe, die dich als Ziel haben, wenn du beritten bist und dein Reittier im Weg sein könnte.</p>\n<p>Da du dich nicht so frei bewegen kannst, wenn du auf einem Reittier sitzt, erhältst du einen Situationsmalus von-2 auf Reflexwürfe, wenn du beritten bist. Außerdem ist @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.PM5jvValFkbFH3TV]{Aufsitzen} (hier zum Absitzen) die einzige Bewegungsaktion, die du einsetzen kannst.</p>\n<h2>Kampf in der Luft</h2>\n<p>Viele Monster können fliegen und auch SC können mit Zaubern oder Gegenständen die Möglichkeit zu fliegen erhalten. Fliegende Kreaturen benutzen zur Fortbewegung durch die Luft die Aktion Fliegen. Besonders knifflige Manöver, z.B. eine 180-Grad-Kehrtwende oder Fliegen durch eine schmale Lücke, erfordern möglicherweise Fertigkeitswürfe auf Akrobatik zum @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Qf1ylAbdVi1rkc8M]{Im Flug manövrieren}. Kreaturen können auch aus der Luft abstürzen. Dazu finden die @UUID[.7FsXXkrOUXHtROnq]{Sturzregeln} Anwendung. Der SL kann nach eigenem Gutdünken entscheiden, dass manche bodenbasierenden Handlungen in der Luft nicht funktionieren. Eine fliegende Kreatur kann z.B. nicht @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.d5I6018Mci2SWokk]{Springen}.</p>\n<h2>Kampf im Wasser</h2>\n<p>Benutze die folgenden Regeln für Kampf im oder unter Wasser:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Du bist @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Auf dem Falschen Fuß} betroffen, wenn du keine Bewegungsrate für Schwimmen hast.</li>\n<li>Du erhältst Resistenz 5 gegen Säure und Feuer.</li>\n<li>Du erleidest einen Situationsmalus von -2 auf Angriffswürfe mit Hieb- und Wuchtwaffen, die durch Wasser gehen.</li>\n<li>Fernkampfangriffe, die Hieb- oder Wuchtschaden zufügen, schlagen automatisch fehl, wenn sich der Angreifer oder das Ziel unter Wasser befindet. Für Fernkampfangriffe, die Stichschaden verursachen, durch oder gegen eine Kreatur, die sich unter Wasser befindet, wird die Entfernungseinheit der Waffe halbiert.</li>\n<li>Unter Wasser kannst du keine Feuerzauber einsetzen und keine Aktionen mit der Kategorie Feuer benutzen.</li>\n<li>Der SL kann nach eigenem Gutdünken entscheiden, dass manche bodenbasierenden Handlungen unter oder auf dem Wasser nicht funktionieren.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ertrinken und Ersticken</h3>\n<p>Du kannst eine Anzahl von Runden gleich 5 + dein Konstitutionsmodifikator lang die Luft anhalten. Reduziere die Anzahl der Runden, die du noch Luft hast, jeweils am Ende deines Zuges um 1, bzw. um 2, falls du während deines Zuges Zauber gewirkt hast. Du verlierst weiterhin jedes Mal eine Runde an Luft, wenn du einen Kritischen Treffer erleidest oder bei einem Rettungswurf gegen einen Schadenseffekt einen Kritischen Fehlschlag erzielst. Wenn du sprichst (dazu zählen auch Zauber mit Verbalen Komponenten oder die Aktivierung von Gegenständen mit Befehlsworten), verlierst du alle verbliebenen Runden an Luft.</p>\n<p>Wenn dir die Luft ausgeht, erhältst du den Zustand @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Bewusstlos} und beginnst zu ersticken. Du kannst dich von dieser Bewusstlosigkeit nicht erholen und musst jeweils am Ende deines Zuges einen @Check[fortitude|dc:20]{Zähigkeitswurf} ablegen. Bei einem Fehlschlag nimmst du [[/r 1d10]]{1W10 Schaden}. Bei einem Kritischen Fehlschlag stirbst du. Mit jedem weiteren Wurf nach dem ersten, erhöht sich der SG kumulativ um 5 und der Schaden kumulativ um 1W10. Sobald du wieder Luft holen kannst, musst du nicht mehr weiter ersticken und verlierst den Zustand Bewusstlos (sofern du nicht bei 0 Trefferpunkten bist).</p>"

Sie erleiden lediglich Kratzer oder kleine Fleischwunden und brauchen nicht mehr als eine kurze Verschnaufpause, um wieder auch die Beine zu kommen. Falls deine Gruppe Teil einer solchen Geschichte sein will, kannst du die Ausdauer-Regelvariante nutzen, um dies zu erreichen.</p>\n<h2>Ausdauerpunkte</h2>\n<p>Ausdauerpunkte repräsentieren die Energie und Bereitschaft eines Charakters. Sie werden wie Trefferpunkte durch Schaden verringert, jedoch verliert ein Charakter immer zunächst seine Ausdauerpunkte und erst wenn diese leer sind, seine Trefferpunkte. Falls ein Charakter Schaden über seine verbleibenden Ausdauerpunkte hinaus verliert, verringert der überschüssige Schaden die Trefferpunkte des Charakters. Dennoch verlieren Charakter jegliche temporären Trefferpunkte, bevor sie Ausdauerpunkte verlieren.</p>\n<p>Obwohl Ausdauerpunkte und Trefferpunkte ähnlich funktionieren, wenn ein Charakter Schaden nimmt, erhält er sie auf unterschiedliche Weise zurück. Der Zauber @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.rfZpqmj0AIIdkVIs]{Heilung} gibt Trefferpunkte - nicht Ausdauerpunkte - zurück und die unten beschriebenen Handlungen (wie @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.qc0VsZ0UesnurUUB]{Zu Atem kommen}) gibt Ausdauerpunkte zurück - nicht Trefferpunkte. Ein Charakter erhält nach einer vollständigen Nacht ungestörten Schlafs alle seine Ausdauerpunkte zurück. Die Trefferpunkte eines Charakter bestimmen weiterhin, ob er bei Bewusstsein ist - ein Charakter mit 0 TP ist bewusstlos, egal wie viele Ausdauerpunkte er noch hat.</p>\n<p>Zusätzlich zu den Trefferpunkten durch seine Abstammung erhält ein SC bei der Charaktererschaffung eine Anzahl von Ausdauer - und Trefferpunkten entsprechend der zweiten und dritten Spalte in der Tabelle oben. Beide Werte erhöhen sich bei jeden Stufenaufstieg um die gleiche Menge. Dies ersetzt die Trefferpunkte, die ein Charakter unter den Standardregeln erhalten würde.</p>\n<h2>Reservepunkte</h2>\n<p>Bei dieser Regelvariante hat jeder SC zusätzlich einen Vorrat von Reservepunkten, der ihr Glück und ihre innere Entschlossenheit darstellt. Das Maximum an Reservepunkten eines Charakters entspricht dem Modifikator seines Schlüsselattributs und jeder Charakter erhält alle seine Reservepunkte nach einer Nacht ungestörten Schlafs zurück. Zusätzlich zur Möglichkeit Reservepunkte auszugeben, um Ausdauerpunkte wiederzuerlangen (wie unter Ausdauerhandlungen beschrieben), kann ein Charakter Reservepunkte auf die folgende Weise nutzen.</p>\n<h3>Stabilisieren</h3>\n<p>Hat ein Charakter am Anfang der Runde den Zustand @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Sterbend}, kann sein Spieler einen Reservepunkt ausgeben, um ihn bei 0 TP zu stabilisieren. Wie gewohnt erhält oder erhöht der Charakter den Zustand @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Verwundet} aufgrund der Stabilisierung. Zu Beginn der nächsten Runde des Charakters erhält er 1 TP und wacht auf (solange er nicht erneut den Zustand Sterbend erhalten hat). Der Charakter kann in diesem Zug normal handeln. Sieh dies als optionale Regel, die am besten zu Gruppen passt, die wenig Zugriff auf Heilung haben. Wenn du diese Regel benutzt, könntest du für Charaktere die Möglichkeit weglassen, Heldenpunkten zum Stabilisieren zu nutzen.</p>\n<h2>Ausdauerhandlungen</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.qc0VsZ0UesnurUUB]{Zu Atem kommen}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.xJEkXFJgEfEida27]{Sammeln}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Ausdauertalente</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.dUnT3HWMFD3d2eBJ]{Ermutigende Worte}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.jFmdevE4nKevovzo]{Entschlossenheit festigen}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Andere Kreaturen</h2>\n<p>Es gibt keinen Grund Monster mit Ausdauerpunkten zu versehen, denen die SC nur einmal begegnen und die sie wahrscheinlich besiegen. Dennoch könntest du Ausdauerpunkte für wiederkehrende Charaktere benutzen, insbesondere für NSC, die an der Seite der SC kämpfen. Normalerweise ist es am einfachsten, die Hälfte der Trefferpunkte der Kreatur in Ausdauerpunkte umzuwandeln. Obwohl die Heiler der Feinde wie zuvor ihre Funktion erfüllen, könnten sich die Spieler darüber ärgern, dass es den Feinden möglich ist, innerhalb des Kampfes ihre vollen Trefferpunkte zurückzuerlangen, während die SC die Ausdauerpunkte ihrer Verbündeten nicht heilen können. In diesem Fall kannst du zum Ausgleich mehr Gegnern Ausdauerpunkte geben.</p>\n<h2>Unendliche Ausdauer</h2>\n<p>Falls du ein schnelles und nahezu superheldenhaftes Spiel haben möchtest, kannst du Reservepunkte als Komponente der Regelvariante weglassen und einfach die Handlungen Zu Atem kommen und Sammeln kostenlos machen. Dies gibt den Charakteren eine Menge gleichbleibender Macht, was bedeutet, dass die Gruppe typischerweise kampfbereit bleibt, bis ihr die Zauber für diesen Tag ausgehen, anstatt dass sie sich zusätzlich Sorgen machen müssen, dass ihnen die Reservepunkte ausgehen. Falls du diesen Ansatz verfolgen möchtest, verbiete das Talent Entschlossenheit festigen. Da es kostenlos nutzbar wäre, wäre es einfach zu mächtig! Falls du das Talent dennoch beibehalten möchtest, könntest du einem Charakter auferlegen, dass er zunächst die Handlung Zu Atem kommen ausführen muss, bevor er erneut Entschlossenheit festigen nutzen kann.</p>\n<h2>Ausdauer im Spiel</h2>\n<p>Die Hauptkonsequenz der Ausdauerregeln für das Spiel ist, dass eine kurze 10 - oder 20minütige Rast die meisten Gruppen durch @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.qc0VsZ0UesnurUUB]{Zu Atem kommen} und @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1kGNdIIhuglAjIp9]{Wunden versorgen} wieder zu voller oder fast voller Gesundheit kommen lässt. Dies führt dazu, dass mehr Begegnungen mit kürzeren Pausen dazwischen stattfinden können. Zusätzlich erhalten charismatische oder auf andere Weise diplomatische Charaktere interessante und nützliche Wege, ihre Verbündeten zu unterstützen.</p>\n<p>Weil Zauber, die Trefferpunkte heilen, keine Ausdauerpunkte zurückgeben, ist es etwas schwerer, Charaktere inmitten eines Kampfes komplett zu heilen. Dies kann bedeuten, dass Kämpfe tödlicher werden, nachdem Charaktere einmal niedergeschlagen wurden, was möglicherweise dazu führt, dass sie sich häufiger zurückziehen müssen - nichtsdestotrotz wären die Rückzugspausen selbst kürzer. Der Fokus des Spiels kann so durchgängig auf Begegnungen liegen und weniger Zeit - und Ressourcenmanagement außerhalb des Kampfes erfordern.</p>"

Stufe sollten Gegenstände aus Kapitel 6 sein und keine magischen Gegenstände.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Schätze (Abenteuer erstellen)</h2>\n<p>Dein Abenteuer sollte eine passend zur Stufe der Charaktere bestimmte Menge an Schätzen ausschütten. Du kannst so alle möglichen Schätze ausgeben, seien es Schatzhorte von Monstern, mitgeführte Dinge von Gegnern oder Belohnungen von Auftraggebern. Die Schätze sollten dabei über das Abenteuer verteilt sein, statt quasi auf einem Haufen zu liegen. Auf diese Weise werden die Spieler schrittweise belohnt und können sich in vielen kleinen Schritten verbessern, statt Riesensprünge z.B. erst nach vielen Spielstunden zu machen.</p>\n<h2>Schätze</h2>\n<p>Als SL gibst du Schätze an die Spielercharaktere aus. Schätze werden im Rahmen eines Abenteuers gefunden und die SC gelangen an sie, indem sie Schatzhorte plündern, Gegner besiegen und ihnen Wertsachen oder Geld abnehmen, für erfolgreich erledigte Questen entlohnt werden und dergleichen.</p>\n<p>Dieser Abschnitt liefert Richtlinien zur Vergabe von Schätzen im Rahmen typischer Pathfinderkampagnen, du kannst aber stets mehr oder weniger ausgeben, solltest du eine Kampagne für sehr mächtige Charaktere planen oder die SC eher in einer finsteren Welt ums Überleben kämpfen.</p>\n<h2>Schätze nach Stufe</h2>\n<p>Die Tabelle Gruppenreichtum nach Stufe gibt an, wie viele Schätze du im Laufe einer Stufe an eine vierköpfige SC-Gruppe ausschütten solltest. Die Spalte Gesamtvermögen besagt grob, wie viel alle Schätze zusammen wert sein sollten, falls du mit einem Budget arbeiten willst. Die nächsten Spalten teilen diesen Gesamtwert in Permanentgegenstände, welche die SC eine Zeitlang behalten und nutzen, Verbrauchsgegenstände, die nach der Nutzung zerstört werden, und Vermögen auf, welches Münzen, Edelsteine und andere Wertsachen umfasst, die hauptsächlich zum Erwerb von Gegenständen und Dienstleistungen aufgewendet werden. Die letzte Spalte benennt die Menge an Vermögen, welche pro SC hinzugefügt wird, um den die Gruppengröße 4 SC übersteigt. Nutze diese Spalte nur, wenn die Gruppe auch wirklich größer ist (für weitere Details hierzu siehe oben unter: Gruppen aus Charakteren verschiedener Stufen).</p>\n<p>Beispielsweise sollte eine Gruppe aus Charakteren der 3. Stufe auf dem Weg zur 4. Stufe die für die 3. Stufe aufgeführten Schätze im Wert von etwa 500 GM erhalten: zwei Permanentgegenstände der 4. Stufe, zwei Permanentgegenstände der 3. Stufe, zwei Verbrauchsgegenstände der 4. Stufe, zwei Verbrauchsgegenstände der 3. Stufe, zwei Verbrauchsgegenstände der 2. Stufe und Vermögen im Wert von 120 GM.</p>\n<p>Bei Permanentgegenständen der 1. Stufe solltest du vornehmlich Rüstungen, Waffen und andere \nAusrüstungsgegenstände im Wert zwischen 10 und 20 GM ausgeben, welche in Kapitel 6 zu finden sind. Die in der Zeile für Stufe 20 aufgeführten Schätze repräsentieren eine volle Stufe an Abenteuern, auch wenn die SC die 21. Stufe nicht erreichen können.</p>\n<p>Manche Kreatureneinträge im Monsterhandbuch benennen Schätze, welche erlangt werden können, wenn eine individuelle Kreatur besiegt wird; dies zählt gegen die Schätze, welche die SC auf der fraglichen Stufe erlangen können.</p>\n<p>Veröffentlichte Abenteuer enthalten eine passende, über das Abenteuer verteilte Menge an Schätzen, aber achte dennoch zur Sicherheit darauf, dass die SC hinsichtlich der Ausrüstung nicht den Anschluss verlieren, sollten sie z.B. nicht alle Schätze finden.</p>\n<h3>Vermögen</h3>\n<p>Eine Gruppe wird Geld und andere Schätze finden, die so nicht zu gebrauchen sind, dafür aber verkauft, verarbeitet oder für andere Dinge ausgegeben werden können. Der GM-Wert in der Spalte Gruppenvermögen bezieht sich nicht nur auf Münzen - Edelsteine, Kunstgegenstände, Handwerksmaterialien (wertvolle Materialien eingeschlossen), Schmuck und sogar Gegenstände von viel niedrigerer Stufe als die Gruppenstufe könnten deutlich interessanter als ein Berg Goldmünzen sein.</p>\n<p>Solltest du einen niedrigstufigeren Permanentgegenstand als Teil einer Belohnung mit Vermögen nutzen, so rechne nur den halben Preis des Gegenstandes gegen den GM-Betrag, da die Gruppe den Gegenstand wohl verkaufen oder als Handwerksmaterial nutzen wird. Niedrigstufigere Verbrauchsgegenstände - insbesondere Schriftrollen - könnten allerdings noch immer nützlich sein und wenn du glaubst, deine Gruppe würde sie benutzen, so zähle diese Gegenstände zum vollen Preis.</p>\n<h3>Andere Arten von Schätzen</h3>\n<p>Nicht alle Schätze müssen Gegenstände oder Vermögen sein. Handwerker können mittels Handwerkskunst Rohstoffe direkt in Gegenstände umwandeln, statt diese Gegenstände mit Münzen zu erwerben. Wissen kann die Fähigkeiten eines Charakters erweitern und Anleitungen und Formeln eignen sich als Schätze für Charaktere, die Gegenstände herstellen wollen. Ein Zauberwirker könnte durch das Zauberbuch eines Gegners oder einen uralten Gelehrten Zugang zu neuen Zaubern erlangen, während ein Mönch seine Techniken während des Trainings durch einen Meister auf einer fernen Bergspitze umlernen könnte.</p>\n<h3>Schätze und Seltenheit</h3>\n<p>Wenn du Gegenstände und Anleitungen der Seltenheitskategorien Ungewöhnlich oder Selten ausgibst, kannst du das Interesse der Spieler erhalten. Am besten nutzt du ungewöhnliche Gegenstände relativ regelmäßig als Belohnung, seltene Gegenstände dagegen nur zuweilen. Diese Belohnungen sind besonders spannend, wenn die Abenteurer den Gegenstand einem besiegten oder ausgetricksten Gegner abnehmen und er obendrein zu ihrer Hintergrundgeschichte oder Thematik passt.</p>\n<p>Ungewöhnliche oder seltene Anleitungen sind großartige Schätze für Charaktere, die Gegenstände herstellen. Beachte, dass eine ungewöhnliche oder seltene Anleitung, die großflächig in Umlauf gebracht wird, letztendlich weiterverbreitet und damit gewöhnlicher wird. Dies kann Monate oder Jahre dauern, aber am Ende könnte der Gegenstand weltweit in Geschäften auftauchen.</p>\n<h3>Unterschiedliche Gegenstandsstufen</h3>\n<p>Die in der Tabelle aufgeführten Gegenstandsstufen sind nicht in Stein gemeißelt. Du kannst Gegenstände mit leicht höherer oder niedrigerer Stufe ausgeben, solange du auf den Wert der Gegenstände achtest.</p>\n<p>Nehmen wir z.B. an, dass du einer Gruppe aus SC der 11. Stufe einen @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.ev3F9qlMNlNdCOAI]{Runenstein} mit der @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.8buhFcGwuaJRrp0y]{Verstärkt}-Rune als Gegenstand der 12. Stufe zukommen lassen willst (Preis 2.000 GM). Du erkennst aber, dass die SC in den letzten Abenteuern kaum Rüstungen gefunden haben, daher entscheidest du dich stattdessen eine <em>+2 Rüstung des Wiederstandes</em> (1.400 GM) auszugeben. Da die Rüstung weniger kostet als die Rune, könntest du zudem eine @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.bSm0Hki8N2L50OZw]{Schattenwandelnrune} der 9. Stufe (650 GM) hinzufügen, um die Differenz auszugleichen. Das ist zwar nicht dasselbe, aber völlig in Ordnung.</p>\n<p>Wenn du allerdings z.B. einen Permanentgegenstand der 13. Stufe in einem Schatzhort platzieren willst, könntest du dafür zwei Permanentgegenstände der 11. Stufe entfernen, die grob denselben Wert besitzen. Sei bei solchen stufenmäßig vorteilhaften Wechseln aber achtsam - ein Gegenstand könnte für die aktuelle Stufe der SC zu mächtig sein. Ebenso solltest du den tollen Gegenstand nicht einem SC allein zukommen lassen, während die anderen in die Röhre schauen!</p>\n<p>Solltest du eine langfristig angelegte Kampagne spielen, kannst du die Schätze über den Handlungsablauf verteilen. Ein wichtiger Meilenstein in der Handlung kann auf einer Stufe zusätzliche Schätze geben. Dem folgt dann ein härteres Gewölbe mit weniger neuen Gegenständen auf der nächsten Stufe. Überschlage zuweilen, ob jeder SC im Vergleich zu einem neuerschaffenen Charakter der aktuellen Stufe genug Schätze hat, was weiter unten unter Schätze für neue Charaktere beschrieben wird. Die SC sollten etwas reicher sein, doch sollte es beachtliche Abweichungen geben, dann passe die Belohnungen in den kommenden Abenteuern entsprechend an.</p>\n<h3>Unterschiedliche Gruppengrößen</h3>\n<p>Sollte die Gruppe aus mehr als vier Charakteren bestehen, so addiere pro weiteren Charakter die folgenden Dinge hinzu:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ein Permanentgegenstand der Gruppenstufe oder mit Gruppenstufe + 1</li>\n<li>Zwei Verbrauchsgegenstände, einer mit der Gruppenstufe und einer mit Gruppenstufe + 1</li>\n<li>Vermögen in Höhe des Eintrags Vermögen pro weiterem SC in der Tabelle</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sollte die Gruppe aus weniger als vier Charakteren bestehen, kannst du dasselbe pro fehlenden Charakter abziehen. Da das Spiel aber bei einer kleineren Gruppe herausfordernder ist, welche nicht alle Rollen ebenso effizient abdecken kann, könntest du andenken, weniger Schätze abzuziehen und stattdessen die zusätzliche Ausrüstung als Ausgleich für die geringere Anzahl an SC betrachten.</p>\n<p><strong>Seitenbalken</strong> @UUID[.f2wr86966A0oUUA0]{Schätze anpassen}</p>\n<h2>Gegenstände kaufen und verkaufen</h2>\n<p>Charaktere können in der Regel nur während der Auszeit ein- und verkaufen. Ein Gegenstand kann in der Regel nur zum halben Preis verkauft werden, die Ausnahme bilden Kunstgegenstände, Edelsteine und Rohmaterialien - diese können zum vollen Preis verkauft werden (siehe Seite 271 GRW).</p>\n<h2>Schätze (Spielleiterhandbuch)</h2>\n<p>Die Mathematik des Spieles basiert darauf, dass die SC Gegenstände finden, kaufen oder herstellen, welche dieselbe Stufe besitzen wie sie - dies umfasst auch Waffen und Rüstungen mit Fundamentalrunen und Gegenstände, welche bei den Fertigkeiten und Taktiken der SC helfen. Ein SC, der einen Gegenstand seiner Stufe erhält, ist meistens kurzfristig den Monstern, Gefahren und Fertigkeits-SG voraus, ehe er wieder von ihren Herausforderungen eingeholt wird. Die Richtlinien für das Verteilen von Schätzen lassen dich aber der Gruppe Gegenstände geben, deren Stufe um 1 höher ist als die der SC. Dies bedeutet, dass in Abenteuern gefundene Gegenstände mächtiger sind, als was ein SC herstellen könnte (der ja auf seine Stufe beschränkt ist). Die Schatzverteilung erfolgt über eine Stufe hinweg statt pro Begegnung, da manche Begegnungen keine Schätze bringen, manche mehr Schätze und manche Schatzhorte oder Belohnungen vielleicht abseits einer Begegnung zu finden sind. Sollte deine Kampagnenstruktur besser funktionieren, indem du Schätze für einzelne Begegnungen ausgibst, dann siehe @UUID[.oBOw6E6V7ncrB1rN]{Schätze pro Begegnung}.</p>\n<p>Wenn du Schätze auswählst, dann orientiere dich am Fluss der Schätze in deiner Kampagne und schau, welche SC einen Machtvorsprung besitzen und welche zurückgefallen sind. Meistens ist es das Beste, „Kerngegenstände“ (Schätze, die mit den Hauptfähigkeiten eines SC korrespondieren) und Schätze zu vermengen, welche ungewöhnliche, weniger breitgefächert nutzbare Eigenschaften haben. Ein Streiter kauft vielleicht keine @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.gp5kgCySEOuntQPF]{Ritterrüstung der Tiefe}, wird eine gefundene aber dennoch tragen (solange er nichts Besseres findet). Diese Gegenstände sollten immer von Nutzen sein - eine Gruppe ohne Zauberkundigen der Tradition der Naturmagie hat z.B. kaum Nutzen für einen @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.WcuknnE3xYfSdbhm]{Zauberstecken der Tiere}.\n<p>Wie viele Kerngegenstände du ausgeben solltest, hängt teilweise davon ab, in welchem Umfang die Kampagne Erwerben und Herstellen von Gegenständen erlaubt.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kann fast alles erworben werden, haben die SC fast ständig Zugang zu einem Marktplatz oder Händler und haben sie zudem viel Zeit zum Herstellen von Dingen, dann sollte es sich etwa bei der Hälfte der ausgegebenen Permanentgegenstände zum Kerngegenstände handeln. Die SC kommen mit ziemlicher Sicherheit an alles, was sie wollen (und sie sich leisten können).</li>\n<li>Ist der Erwerb von Gegenständen und Anleitungen/Formeln schwierig, dann sollten drei Viertel der Permanentgegenstände Kerngegenstände sein. Wenn ein SC einen bestimmten Gegenstand wirklich haben will, dann muss er sich etwas anstrengen.</li>\n<li>Sollte es keine Händler für magische Gegenstände oder andere Möglichkeiten zum Erwerb von Gegenständen und Anleitungen geben, dann verteile nur Kerngegenstände als Permanentgegenstände und überlege, eventuell die Variantregeln für @UUID[.SnSGU7DPiogZ9JOr]{automatische Boni} zu nutzen, um den Bedarf an Kerngegenständen zu eliminieren.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Gegenstände verkaufen</h2>\n<p>Die Möglichkeit, alte Ausrüstung und andere Beute verkaufen zu können, spielt eine wichtige Rolle, ob und wie weit die SC sich ausrüsten können, wie sie wollen. Bei einer Pathfinderkampagne wird eigentlich davon ausgegangen, dass die SC nicht für jeden Gegenstand einen Käufer finden - insbesondere wenn sie mehrere Versionen eines Gegenstandes verkaufen wollen (jedenfalls nicht zum normalen Verkaufspreis). Die Spieler sollten nicht erwarten, alles Mögliche verkaufen zu können, wo und wann es ihnen einfällt. Wo keine Nachfrage besteht, will wahrscheinlich niemand ihr Angebot erwerben, so dass sie den Preis senken müssen. Ebenso wird man teure Gegenstände schlecht an Orten los, wo gar nicht die nötige Kaufkraft existiert.</p>\n<p>Falls du nicht mit diesem Detailgrad hantieren willst, kannst du den Verkauf von Gegenständen eher abstrakt abhandeln und den SC gestatten, praktisch alles zu jeder Zeit zum halben Preis verkaufen zu können. Da dies den SC erleichtert, sich nach Belieben auszustatten, sind sie am Ende möglicherweise aber mächtiger, als ihre Stufe eigentlich vorsieht.</p>"

Anders als die Standardtabelle umfasst sie nicht Gegenstände nach Gegenstandstufe, da der Wert sich der Wert in den meisten Begegnungen nicht klar teilen lässt.

Der Schaden, den du dem Patienten im Fall eines Kritischen Fehlschlages zufügst, bleibt derselbe, egal welchen Kompetenzgrad du besitzt.</p>\n<p>Gelingt dir der Fertigkeitswurf, kannst du das Ziel weiterbehandeln, um ihm zusätzliche Heilung zukommen zu lassen. Dehnst du die Behandlungszeit von den normalen 10 Minuten auf 1 Stunde aus, so verdopple die Anzahl an Trefferpunkten, welche der Patient durch Wunden versorgen zurückerlangt.

Dieser Abschnitt erklärt, wie du zu diesem Zweck eigene Untersysteme entwickeln kannst, die Siegpunkte nutzen. Auch manche andere Untersysteme in diesem Kapitel greifen auf diesen Mechanismus zurück, nutzen dabei aber oft einen anderen Namen.</p>\n<p>Siegpunkte (oder SiP) sind ein mächtiges Werkzeug im Arsenal des SL, da du mit ihnen die Fortschritte der SC über einen einzelnen Wurf hinaus verfolgen kannst. Siegpunkte sind zudem vielseitig - du könntest sie im Rahmen einer einzelnen Begegnung nutzen oder über den Verlauf einer ganzen Kampagne, um das Ende der Handlung zu bestimmen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Siegpunkte für den Feind</h3>\n<p>Manchmal ergibt es mehr Sinn, wenn nur der Gegner Siegpunkte sammelt, statt sowohl den SC als auch ihren Gegnern Punkte zu geben. Dabei sollten die Handlungen der SC den Ausschlag geben, ob die Gegenseite Punkte erhält oder verliert, auch wenn die Gegner selbst etwas tun. Dies gibt den Spielern das Gefühl, dass ihre Aktionen den Ausschlag geben. In jenen seltenen Fällen, in denen die Gegner direkt gegen die SC aktiv werden, könntest du in Betracht ziehen, dass auch dieses Tun ihnen Siegpunkte verschafft.</p>\n<p>Bei einem solchen Untersystem müssen oft die Würfe neu interpretiert werden - wenn z.B. die SC versuchen, den Einfluss der Gegenseite auf einen NSC zu minimieren, reduziert ein Kritischer Erfolg den gegnerischen Einfluss um 2 und ein normaler Erfolg um 1, während ein Kritischer Fehlschlag dem Gegner genug Spielraum eröffnet, um 1 Punkt an Einfluss auf den fraglichen NSC zu erlangen. Die Effekte sind von den Würfen abhängig, doch statt den SC Siegpunkte zu verschaffen, verliert die Gegenseite ihre Siegpunkte. Bei einer auf Intrigen basierenden Handlung hat dies viel passendere Auswirkungen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Dem Kind einen Namen geben</h2>\n<p>Wie sollen die Siegpunkte im fraglichen Anwendungsbereich heißen? Der Begriff „Siegpunkte“ ist unspezifisch, daher kannst du dem System einen zur Handlung passenden Namen geben, der den Spielern das Gefühl verleiht, sie würden vollkommen zur fraglichen Handlung passen. Beispiele wären Einflusspunkte (Seite 151), Infiltrationspunkte (Seite 160), Nachforschungspunkte (Seite 154) und Rufpunkte (Seite 164). Der Name sollte repräsentativ sein und den Spielern sagen, was diese Punkte nachverfolgen. Du kannst auch auf das Wort „Punkte“ verzichten, im Kapitel wird es aber weiterhin genutzt.</p>\n<h2>Aufbau von Siegpunkten-Untersystemen</h2>\n<p>Bei Systemen, die Siegpunkte nutzen, gibt es einige Gemeinsamkeiten. Du kannst dein eigenes Untersystem an einem der folgenden Beispiele ausrichten oder dein eigenes mit völlig neuen Strukturen entwickeln, sollte keines davon zu deinem Spielstil passen. Am wichtigsten ist die Frage, wie die SC oder ihre Gegner verschiedene Arten von Siegpunkten erlangen oder verlieren könnten.</p>\n<h3>Siegpunkte ansammeln</h3>\n<p>Meistens sammelt man Siegpunkte, während man auf ein Ziel hinarbeitet. Entweder hört man mit Sammeln auf, wenn ein bestimmter Punkte erreicht wurde, vielleicht gilt es auch, möglichst viele Siegpunkte innerhalb einer bestimmten Zeit zu erlangen, die sodann mit verschiedenen Schwellenwerten verglichen werden. Für diese Art von Untersystem stellt das Einfluss-Untersystem auf Seite 151 ein gutes Beispiel dar: Jeder SC hat eine begrenzte Anzahl an Chancen, um verschiedene NSC zu beeinflussen - wurde bei einem NSC ein bestimmter Punktewert erreicht, wurde dieser NSC überzeugt.</p>\n<p>Bei einer Variante dieser Struktur erlangen auch die Gegner der SC Siegespunkte. Die SC erhalten so ein bewegliches Ziel - entweder müssen sie das Ziel vor dem Gegner erreichen oder am Ende eines bestimmten Zeitfensters mehr Siegpunkte als der Gegner erlangt haben. Diese Version des Systems lässt sich bestens in einer Situation nutzen, in welcher die SC es mit Gegnern zu tun haben, statt Siegpunkte anzuhäufen, während die Gegenseite den Punktewert wieder reduziert, da dies dynamischer ist und das Risiko eines Gleichstandes verringert wird.</p>\n<p>Du kannst ein Untersystem in größerem Maßstab nutzen, z.B. für ein ganzes Abenteuer oder über eine ganze Kampagne hinweg, indem die SC Siegpunkte für das Erreichen schwieriger Ziele oder das Treffen bestimmter Entscheidungen erhalten. Bei solchen Untersystemen werden die von den SC angesammelten Siegpunkte mit diversen Schwellenwerten verglichen, die zu jeweils unterschiedlichen Ergebnissen für die Handlung führen. Meistens werden diese Ergebnisse für die SC zunehmend besser, je mehr Punkte sie ansammeln, wobei ein zu perfekter Erfolg auch zu unbeabsichtigten Konsequenzen führen könnte - so könnte das zu erfolgreiche Überreden von Arbeitern, eine Rebellion zu unterstützen, einen unberechenbaren Mob entfesseln. Wenn du dein eigenes Untersystem entwickelst, musst du die verschiedenen möglichen Ergebnisse nicht vollständig definieren, Stichworte genügen.</p>\n<h4>Punkte über Würfe sammeln</h4>\n<p>Sollten die SC Würfe ablegen müssen, um Siegpunkte zu erhalten, bestimmst du den Grad anhand des Erfolgs. Die folgende Standardskala passt in den meisten Fällen:</p>\n<p><strong>Kritischer Erfolg</strong> Die SC erhalten 2 Siegpunkte.</p>\n<p><strong>Erfolg</strong> Die SC erhalten 1 Siegpunkt.</p>\n<p><strong>Kritischer Fehlschlag</strong> Die SC verlieren 1 Siegpunkt.</p>\n<p>Dies hat zur Folge, dass die SC durch ihre Würfe in der Regel 1 Siegpunkt erlangen oder keinen. Spezialisierte SC besitzen dagegen eine solide Chance, der Gruppe 2 Siegpunkte einzubringen, während dämliche Pläne sie wahrscheinlich 1 Siegpunkt kosten werden.</p>\n<h3>Abnehmende Siegpunkte</h3>\n<p>Bei dieser Methode beginnen die SC mit einer bestimmten Anzahl an Siegpunkten. Doch statt Punkte zu sammeln, bemühen sie sich, keine zu verlieren. Vielleicht müssen die SC verhindern, dass Dracheneier zerbrochen werden, vielleicht versuchen sie, Schaden, Verluste oder Gefahren einzugrenzen. Diese Variante ist weniger verbreitet, eignet sich aber bestens, um die Dringlichkeit einer Lage zu vermitteln, da die SC Punkte verlieren - und Punkte verlieren ist für die meisten Spieler gar nichts Gutes! Daher ist es zuweilen nötig, derartigen Druck mit einem Untersystem zu vermitteln. Wenn die SC alle Siegpunkte verloren haben, tritt ein negatives Ereignis ein. Sollten die SC sich einen Wettlauf mit der Zeit liefern, könnte das letztendliche Ergebnis besser ausfallen, je mehr Punkte bei Ablauf der Zeit noch verbleiben.</p>\n<h4>Würfe bei abnehmenden Siegpunkten</h4>\n<p>Bei Verwendung dieser Regelstruktur verlieren die SC in der Regel Siegpunkte, wenn ihre Würfe scheitern. Sie können auch Punkte aufgrund besonders schlechter Entscheidungen oder waghalsigen Verhaltens verlieren. Auch hier kannst du unterschiedliche Stufen an Ergebnissen nutzen, welche Sinn ergeben, doch die Standarderfolgsgrade sind wie folgt:</p>\n<p><strong>Kritischer Erfolg</strong> Ist das Zurückerlangen von Punkten möglich, erhalten die SC 1 Siegpunkt, ansonsten wie ein Erfolg.</p>\n<p><strong>Erfolg</strong> Die SC verlieren keine Siegpunkte.</p>\n<p><strong>Fehlschlag</strong> Die SC verlieren 1 Siegpunkt.</p>\n<p><strong>Kritischer Fehlschlag</strong> Die SC verlieren 2 Siegpunkte.</p>\n<h3>Mehrere Siegpunkt-Untersysteme zugleich</h3>\n<p>Nutzt du mehrere Arten von Siegpunkten zugleich, misst jede Art etwas anderes. Bei einem Wettlauf über eine lange Strecke hinweg könnten die SC und ihre Gegner z.B. ihre eigenen Marathonpunkte anzusammeln, und wer dabei zuerst 10 Punkte zusammen hat, gewinnt.</p>\n<p>Das Infiltrationssystem auf Seite 160 bietet ein anderes Beispiel für ein Siegpunkte-Untersystem mit mehreren Arten von Punkten. Die SC versuchen, eine bestimmte Anzahl an Infiltrationspunkten zu sammeln, um erfolgreich einen Ort zu infiltrieren. Dabei bemühen sie sich, ihren Feinden keine Alarmpunkte zukommen zu lassen, welche aus misslungenen Würfen resultieren würden.</p>\n<p>Du kannst auch in Betracht ziehen, dies noch mit einem Zeitfaktor zu verbinden - bei einer Infiltration könnten die Gegner der SC in Verlauf der Zeit langsam automatisch Alarmpunkte erhalten.</p>\n<h2>Hindernisse und SG</h2>\n<p>Überlege beim Vorbereiten deines Untersystems, mit welchen Hindernissen es die SC zu tun bekommen und welche Abkürzungen sie vielleicht nutzen könnten. Lege im Vorfeld nach dem üblichen System einige SG fest. Alles andere kannst du improvisieren. Wenn du meinst, du nutzt im Vergleich eher hohe SG, dann balanciere es aus, indem du weniger Siegpunkte zum Erreichen des Zieles oder eines Zwischenzieles voraussetzt (siehe nächster Abschnitt).</p>\n<p>Denk dir einige Möglichkeiten aus, die um einiges leichter sind, und solche, die schwieriger ausfallen. Wem stehen deine SC gegenüber und welche Schwachstellen der Gegenseite könnten die SC ausnutzen? Setze hier niedrige SG oder belohne das Überwinden mit mehr Siegpunkten. SC, die Nachforschungen anstellen oder clevere Strategien erdenken, sollten eine Herausforderung leichter überwinden können.</p>\n<h2>Schwellenwerte festlegen</h2>\n<p>Die Anzahl der benötigten Siegpunkte zum Erreichen von Zielen wirkt sich stark darauf aus, wie sich dein Untersystem im Spiel anfühlt. Möchtest du das Untersystem nur bei einer einzelnen Szene nutzen, z.B. bei Verhandlungen mit einem mächtigen NSC, dann verlange weniger Punkte, als wenn das System während der ganzen Spielsitzung zur Anwendung kommt. Die folgende Tabelle gibt Richtlinien für Schwellenwerte. „Abenteuerweit“ bedeutet, dass das Untersystem Teil eines größeren Narratives ist und Siegpunkte für das Überwinden ganzer Begegnungen oder Gewölbe vergibt statt während nur einer einzelnen Begegnung.</p>\n<p>Dieser größere Maßstab ist für Untersysteme vorgesehen, welche die Aufmerksamkeit der Gruppe sehr in Anspruch nehmen. Ein Untersystem, welches während eines Abenteuers eher im Hintergrund läuft, sollte einen kleineren Maßstab bei den Schwellenwerten nutzen - das ist meistens die Kategorie „Abenteuerweit, Hintergrund“. Der Maßstab kann aber noch geringer ausfallen, z.B. bei einem gewölbebasierenden Abenteuer, bei dem die SC mehrere Gelegenheiten haben, mit einem Koboldstamm zu interagieren, um kleinere Vorteile zu erlangen. Obwohl es sich durch das ganze Abenteuer zieht, könntest du bei dieser Version des Systems einen niedrigeren Zielwert nutzen, da das Erlangen der Siegpunkte kein Hauptpunkt der Handlung ist. Möglicherweise willst du nicht einmal ein Untersystem verwenden!</p>\n<p>Die Tabelle führt auch Werte für einen oder mehrere Schwellenwerte auf. Bei Erreichen dieser Schwellenwerte erhalten die SC einen gewissen Vorteil (oder einen Nachteil, sollte es sich um ein Untersystem mit abnehmenden Punkte handeln). Du kannst diese Zwischenschritte nutzen, damit die Spieler das Gefühl haben, mit der Zeit belohnt zu werden und schrittweise Dinge zu erreichen.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\"><caption><strong>Tabelle: Schwellenwerte</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Dauer der Begegnung</th>\n<th>Benötigte SiP</th>\n<th>Schwellen</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Schnelle Begegnung</td>\n<td>3-5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lange Begegnung</td>\n<td>7-10</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Großteil einer Spielsitzung</td>\n<td>15-25</td>\n<td>5, 10, 15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Abenteuerweit, Hintergrund</td>\n<td>15-20</td>\n<td>5, 10, 15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Abenteuerweit</td>\n<td>25-50</td>\n<td>10, 20, 30, 40</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Die Zahlenwerte hängen auch von verschiedenen Faktoren ab. Dies könnte die SG enthalten, die Anzahl an Gelegenheiten zum Erwerb von Siegpunkten und wie flexibel die SC sein müssen - sollten z.B. alle gezwungen sein, Würfe für Fähigkeiten abzulegen, in denen sie nicht wenigstens den Kompetenzgrad Geübt besitzen, besteht durchaus das Risiko Kritischer Fehlschläge. Ebenso mag es sein, dass die SC ihre Bemühungen auf Dinge ausrichten müssen, die ihnen nicht direkt Siegpunkte einbringen, z.B. Würfe im Rahmen des Einfluss-Untersystems, um Informationen über NSC zu erlangen. Beachte all diese Punkte, wenn du die Anzahl der letztendlich benötigten Siegpunkte bestimmst.</p>\n<h2>Du und dein Untersystem</h2>\n<p>Wenn du dein neues Untersystem einsetzt, dann beachte, dass die Herausforderungen frisch bleiben sollten, indem du unterschiedliche Fertigkeiten und Optionen nutzt, um zu Kreativität und Kooperation zu ermutigen, statt wieder und wieder denselben Wurf zu fordern. Schrittweise Belohnungen sorgen dafür, dass die Spieler dabeibleiben. Du kannst ebenso mit Zeitfenstern arbeiten, um alle SC zur Beteiligung zu ermutigen, oder sogar Mechanismen entwickeln, um die SC direkt einzubinden. Beispielsweise könntest du Würfen Mali auferlegen, wenn immer nur derselbe SC diese Würfe ablegt oder die SC immer Würfe für dieselbe Fähigkeit ablegen.</p>\n<p>Du kannst auch Herausforderungen entwickeln, welche erfordern, dass sich alle SC beteiligen. Wenn z.B. die SC zu einem gesellschaftlichen Ereignis eingeladen sind, bei dem der Gastgeber jeden individuell begrüßt, hat jeder SC Gelegenheit Eindruck zu machen. Während einer Infiltration dagegen muss vielleicht jeder SC sein Können auf dem Gebiet des Schleichens oder Verkleidens beweisen. Wenn jemand für eine Aufgabe besonders geeignet ist, sollten manche Ansätze zu automatischen Erfolgen führen. Pläne, die sehr wahrscheinlich unmöglich sind, können auch zu automatische Fehlschläge führen.</p>\n<h2>Belohnungen</h2>\n<p>Wie du die Belohnungen im Rahmen deines Untersystems strukturierst, hängt hauptsächlich vom Maßstab ab. Ist alles in einer Spielsitzung erledigt, gibt es in der Regel Erfahrungspunkte. Sollte es dagegen besonders fordernd sein, könnte es wie eine Begegnung belohnt werden. Erstreckt sich das Untersystem über mehrere Spielsitzungen oder die ganze Kampagne hinweg, sollte es mit Erreichen verschiedener Wegpunkte Erfahrungspunkte geben. Sollte das System eher im Hintergrund laufen und/oder nicht erfolgsorientiert sein, so sollte es nicht direkt Erfahrungspunkte aus dem System geben, weil der „Erfolg“ nicht definiert ist - z.B. wenn die Entscheidungen der SC bestimmen, welche Art von Herrscher der Schirmherr der SC letztendlich wird, wenn sie ihn auf den Thron gebracht haben.</p>"

Das hat auch Einfluss auf unsere Übersetzungen. Wir haben uns dazu entschieden bei umfangreichen Änderungen an einem Spielelement (z.B. einem Zauber) im Zweifel unsere Übersetzung zu entfernen. Dadurch stehen bis zum Erscheinen entsprechender offizieller Übersetzungen diese Spielelemente nur auf Englisch, dafür aber mit aktualisierten Regeln zur Verfügung.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Mit der Veröffentlichung der Version 5.9.0 des Pathfinder 2e Foundry-Systems sind wir vollständig zu den überarbeiteten Regeln übergegangen. Wir möchten, dass der Übergang zu diesen Regeln für Gruppen so reibungslos wie möglich verläuft.</p>\n<p>Version 6.X fügt die Inhaltsänderungen von Player Core 2 hinzu und schließt damit den Großteil der Remaster-Änderungen am Spiel ab. Der Remaster wird erst mit der Veröffentlichung von \"Lost Omens: Divine Mysteries\" abgeschlossen sein, das eine Remaster-Version jeder Gottheit enthalten wird.</p>\n<p>Dieses Journal dient als Referenz für Spielleiter oder Spieler, die nach etwas suchen, es aber nicht in den Systemkompendien oder Menüs finden können.

Zum Beispiel sind Gesinnungsampullen/Alignment Ampoules in einem Spiel ohne Gesinnung nicht verwendbar. Wer die neuen Veröffentlichungen nutzen möchte, ohne vollständig zu den überarbeiteten Regeln zu wechseln: Durch das PF2e Legacy Data-Modul wurde eine Kopie aller Legacy-Inhalte verfügbar gemacht. Dieses Modul fügt auch die Gesinnung wieder zu Akteuren hinzu.</p>\n<p>Dies ist keine vollständige Übersicht der Änderungen durch die Überarbeitung. Eine vollständige Übersicht kann aus unserem Github-Repository erstellt werden, allerdings sei darauf hingewiesen, dass die erstellte Diff-Datei mehrere tausend Dateien betraf, hauptsächlich durch Änderungen von gespeicherten Namensreferenzen.</p>"

Zuvor festgelegte Gesinnung bei Akteuren ist weiterhin in den Akteursdaten in Form inaktiver Kategorien vorhanden. Diese Kategorien werden auf dem Bogen nicht angezeigt, bis ein Modul sie wieder hinzufügt. Das PF2e Legacy Data-Modul macht das, aber auch kleinere Module können das einfach umsetzen. Du kannst dies auch ohne ein Modul erreichen, indem du die vier Gesinnungskategorien im Menü für Hausregeln als Akteurskategorien registrierst.</p>\n<p>Bösen Scheusalen und guten Celestischen wurde die Kategorie \"Unheilig\" oder \"Heilig\" hinzugefügt. Angriffe von NCCs, die bösen oder guten Schaden verursacht haben, wurden in Angriffe mit Seelenschaden umgewandelt und erhielten die Kategorie \"Unheilig\" oder \"Heilig\".</p>\n<p><strong>Schulen der Magie entfernt</strong> Sieben der acht Schulen der Magie wurden entfernt: Bannmagie, Beschwörungsmagie, Erkenntnismagie, Hervorrufungsmagie, Nekromantie, Verwandlungsmagie und Verzauberungsmagie wurden aus Zaubersprüchen, Fähigkeiten, Ausrüstung und Ähnlichem entfernt. Illusion ist weiterhin eine Kategorie, die in den überarbeiteten Regeln verwendet wird und beibehalten wurde.</p>\n<p><strong>Zauberkomponenten entfernt</strong> Zauberkomponenten (Gesten, Material, Verbal) wurden aus allen Zaubersprüchen entfernt. Wenn ein Zauber die Komponente Verbal hatte, erhielt er die Kategorie \"Konzentration\". Hatte der Zauber Komponente Gesten, erhielt er die Kategorie \"Handhaben\". Als allgemeine Regel erfordern nun alle Zauber das Sprechen. Diese allgemeine Regel wird durch die neue Kategorie \"Subtil\" modifiziert.</p>\n<h2>Sprachen</h2>\n<p>Einige Sprachen wurden umbenannt.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abyssisch (Abyssal) wurde zu Cthonisch (Chthonian).</li>\n<li>Aqual (Aquan) wurde zu Thalassal (Thalassic).</li>\n<li>Aural (Auran) wurde zu Sussural (Sussuran).</li>\n<li>Celestisch (Celestial) wurde zu Empyrisch (Empyrean).</li>\n<li>Druidisch (Druidic) wurde zu Wildsang (Wildsong).</li>\n<li>Gnollisch (Gnoll) wurde zu Kholo (Kholo).</li>\n<li>Ignal (Ignan) wurde zu Pyral (Pyric).</li>\n<li>Infernalisch (Infernal) wurde zu Diabolisch (Diabolic).</li>\n<li>Sylvanisch (Sylvan) wurde zu Feeisch (Fey).</li>\n<li>Terral (Terran) wurde zu Petral (Petran).</li>\n<li>Finsterländisch (Undercommon) wurde zu Sakvroth (Sakvroth).</li>\n</ul>"
