In those cases, you Cast the Spell as a reaction or free action (as appropriate) instead of as an activity. Such cases will be noted in the spell's stat block-for example, \"[reaction] verbal.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Long Casting</strong> Times Some spells take minutes or hours to cast.

You can't use other actions or reactions while casting such a spell, though at the GM's discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these spells have the exploration trait, and you can't cast them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you're casting one, your spell is disrupted.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Components</strong> Each spell lists the spell components required to cast it after the action icons or text, such as \"[three-actions] material, somatic, verbal.\" The spell components, described in detail below, add traits and requirements to the Cast a Spell activity.

Most people thank her for her kind work to channel the sun's power for everyone's safety and livelihood, and thank her clergy for granting her healing power to all who need it. Mortals look to the Dawnflower as an example of boundless love, exquisite kindness, and true patience. They pray to her to heal the sick, lift up the downtrodden, and illuminate darkness of circumstance as well as darkness of spirit. Her followers aspire to emulate her through generosity, nurturing, truthfulness, and selfless courage. They oppose evil everywhere with words first, and when necessary, with scimitar and flame.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> destroy the Spawn of Rovagug, protect allies, provide aid to the sick and wounded, seek and allow redemption</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> create undead, lie, deny a repentant creature an opportunity for redemption, fail to strike down evil</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> healing, honesty, redemption, and the sun</p>"

Most people thank her for her kind work to channel the sun's power for everyone's safety and livelihood, and thank her clergy for granting her healing power to all who need it. Mortals look to the Dawnflower as an example of boundless love, exquisite kindness, and true patience. They pray to her to heal the sick, lift up the downtrodden, and illuminate darkness of circumstance as well as darkness of spirit. Her followers aspire to emulate her through generosity, nurturing, truthfulness, and selfless courage. They oppose evil everywhere with words first, and when necessary, with scimitar and flame.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> destroy the Spawn of Rovagug, protect allies, provide aid to the sick and wounded, seek and allow redemption</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> create undead, lie, deny a repentant creature an opportunity for redemption, fail to strike down evil</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> healing, honesty, redemption, and the sun</p>"

They pray to her to heal the sick, lift up the downtrodden, and illuminate darkness of circumstance as well as darkness of spirit.
