The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>"

      "appearance": "<p>Das Leben hat es nie gut gemeint mit Elsir. Als junger Elf wuchs er in Osirion auf, wo er seine prägende Zeit auf der Straße verbrachte und er nach Nahrung suchen musste, wo er nur konnte. Wäre da nicht ein Rudel wilder Hyänen gewesen, die ihn eines Abends in einer Gasse in die Enge gedrängt hatten, hätte der schwächliche Elf vielleicht nie seine wahre Begabung erkannt. In jenem Moment, als die knurrenden Bestien sich schon bereit machten, ihre Beute zu reißen, erwachte die Magie in seinem Blut zum Leben und er ertränkte sie beinahe in einer schier unendlichen Wasserflut.</p>\n<p>Danach begann Elsir damit, seine neu entdeckte Gabe zu dazu nutzen, Geld zu verdienen. Zuerst führte er an Straßenecken Zaubertricks vor, verlegte sein Geschäft aber schon bald in Tavernen. Sein Talent für Magie wuchs an und ebenso seine Fertigkeiten für Hinterlist und Täuschung. Denn wer, der noch ganz ist bei Trotz ist, würde sich mit ein paar Münzen als Spende zufriedengeben, wenn er einen ganzen Geldbeutel plündern könnte, während dessen Besitzer von einem Zauber abgelenkt ist? Es kam nicht überraschend, dass er schon bald von den Gesetzeshütern gesucht wurde und so floh er nur sechs Monate später aus Osirion. Elsirs Vorgehen - Ankunft in einer neuen Stadt, Darbietungen in Tavernen und an Straßenecken und schließlich die Flucht aus der Stadt - wiederholte sich so über Jahre hinweg.</p>\n<p>Erst als Elsir sich einer Piratenbande anschloss, fand er seine Heimat. Bis heute hat Elsir keine Vorstellung davon, was Kapitän Renlock in ihm sah, doch er ist ihm ewig dankbar für die Jahre, die er an Bord der Messingvogel verbracht hat. Wann immer das Schiff in einem Hafen anlegte, ging er dort seiner Arbeit nach, verdiente sich ein paar Münzen dazu und verschwand wieder, bevor jemand Verdacht schöpfen konnte. Derweil machte ihn sein Talent für Wassermagie an Bord des Schiffes unersetzlich. Auch seinen Blick für Wertsachen und magische Gegenstände fand der Kapitän stets hilfreich, wenn die Mannschaft neue Schätze erbeutete.</p>\n<p>Doch unglücklicherweise fand auch dies sein Ende. Nachdem die Messingvogel ein varisisches Handelsschiff geentert hatte, verfluchte eine Hexe an Bord Kapitän Renlocks Schiff. Von diesem Tag an wandte sich das Schicksal gegen die Mannschaft. Elsir war zugegen als dies geschah und er kann nicht anders als glauben, dass der Fluch ganz besonders für ihn gedacht war. Die Meere wandten sich alsbald gegen die Messingvogel und schon bald verfolgte die andoranische Marine das Schiff gnadenlos. Nach einer offenen Schlacht kapitulierte Kapitän Renlock und Elsir bekam endlich das Innere einer Gefängniszelle zu sehen. Ein paar Monate später wurde er wieder freigelassen, fand seinen Weg zurück nach Absalom und ließ das Meer für immer hinter sich - so glaubte er zumindest.</p>\n<p>Dort, in der riesigen Metropole eröffnete er ein Geschäft für magische Kleinigkeiten und Zauberei und benutze seine Talente, um Fälschungen herzustellen oder wertlosen Tand als mächtige Reliquien auszugeben. Wenn ihm die Einheimischen auf die Schliche kamen, packte er einfach seine Sachen zusammen und zog in einen anderen Stadtteil um. In einer Stadt von der Größe Absaloms fand er genügend viele Ort, um fünf Jahre lang Verdächtigungen aus dem Wege zu gehen. Doch der alte Fluch der Hexe hatte ihn nicht vergessen und nachdem ein Kunde mit einem echten verfluchten Ring zu ihm gekommen war, musste Elsir feststellen, dass er nun an dieses üble Ding gebunden war. Dank des Fluchs des Rings siecht sein Körper seitdem langsam dahin.</p>\n<p>Schlimmer noch, es erreichte ihn nun die Nachricht, dass Kapitän Renlock im Gefängnis gestorben war. Der alte Kapitän und sein merkwürdiger mechanischer Vogel waren immer freundlich zu Elsir gewesen, und der Verlust traf ihn schwer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ziele:</strong> Zuallererst ist Elsir auf der Suche nach genügend Geld für einen mächtigen Zauber Fluch brechen, um den Ring loszuwerden, der ihm seine Lebenskraft raubt. Er würde es nie zugeben, doch Elsir ist seines gegenwärtigen Lebens müde. Den Nervenkitzel, den er spürte, wenn er die Reichen übers Ohr hauen konnte, gibt es längst nicht mehr und er würde viel lieber seinen Lebensunterhalt bescheiden und mit ehrlicher Magie verdienen. Es fällt ihm aber schwer, sich eine Welt vorzustellen, in der jemand ihn tatsächlich in einer solchen Rolle akzeptieren würde.</p>\n<p><strong>Persönlichkeit:</strong> Elsir erscheint oft verbittert und abgestumpft. Er hat sein Leben damit verbracht, sich für seinen Lebensunterhalt auf Schwindelei und seine Magie zu verlassen. Auch wenn er seine Ziele normalerweise nur unter Händlern und Adligen sucht, die den Verlust von ein paar Münzen verkraften können, kann doch niemand abstreiten, dass Elsir ein Betrüger ist. Seine Ansichten von der Welt sind zynisch und sein Pessimismus geht häufig mit ihm durch und wie die Jahre ins Land ziehen wird das nur schlimmer und schlimmer. Nichts ist jemals einfach für Elsir - jedenfalls aus seiner Sicht.</p>\n<p><strong>Beziehungen:</strong> Elsir war schon immer ein wenig zynisch, doch früher schimmerte sein Sarkasmus nur gelegentlich durch seine Bemerkungen und Betrachtungen hindurch - heute dagegen steht nahezu alles, was er tut, unter diesem Einfluss.</p>",

For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1* </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1* </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy you gain the trait automatically. If you gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you complete an atone ritual.</p>\n<h2>Anathema</h2>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith.

Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity.

Die anderen Hakenklauen haben bemerkt, dass ihre Magie nur wenig wie die der anderen Kobolddrachenzauberer wirkt. Um es einfach zu sagen: Grimmnir ist ... gruselig. Wo Drachen vor arkaner Macht und eindrucksvollem Charisma nur so strotzen, fühlt sich Grimmnirs Zauberei immer düster und hasserfüllt an, umhüllt mit einer erschaudernden Kälte der Verdammnis, welche das Rückgrat hochklettert und am Geist zu nagen beginnt. Grimmnir wird immer sehr wütend und bekommt leuchtende Augen, wenn jemand das anspricht, weswegen die Hakenklauen das Thema tunlichst vermeiden und nicht mir darüber streiten.</p>\n<p>Grimmnir denkt nur wenig an die anderen. Sie weiß, dass sie ein wahres Kind der Drachen ist. Seit sie ein Schlüpfling war, hat Grimmnir schon von ihnen geträumt, von den weltenbeendenden Wyrmen, die in den finstersten Ecken der Realität lauern, welche unter den Wellen und jenseits des Universums warten, welche an den Wurzeln der Existenz selbst nagen und am Ende aller Tage aus der Tiefe auffahren werden. Auch wenn diese zerstörerischen Kräfte ihr Erbe sind, hat sich Grimmnir doch dazu entschlossen, nicht komplett in die Fußstapfen dieser großen Drachen zu treten. Die Koboldin hat eine sorgsame Abwägung der Vor- und Nachteile durchgeführt und sich dafür entschieden, dass die Zerstörung der Welt sowohl für sie selbst ungelegen käme und auch mehr Ärger mit sich bringen würde, als es wirklich wert wäre.</p>\n<p>Ebenso fühlt sich Grimmnir jedoch ihrem Schicksal verpflichtet, einer der Verschlinger der Welten zu werden, auch wenn sie selbst gar nicht vorhat, Welten zu verschlingen. Für sie bedeutet dies, dass sie wachsen muss, viel größer als jetzt, und ihre Stärke durch jede sich bietende Gelegenheit vergrößern muss. Auch wenn sie sich mit Essen vollstopft und auch schon andere brillante Ideen verfolgt hat, hatte sie bislang noch kein Glück mit dem Wachsen. Aus diesem Grund hat sie ihre Bemühungen auf die Selbstverbesserung verlagert und sich Grimmnir der Miliz der Kobolde angeschlossen. Sie will ihre mit Säure benetzten Klauen und ihren furchterregenden Biss gegen alle Hindernisse einsetzen, die sich ihr in den Weg stellen. Die Hakenklauen erkennen ihre Tapferkeit bei der Verteidigung des Stammes an und schätzen dies sehr, insbesondere wenn Grimmnir draußen auf Patrouille ist und nirgends im Stammesgebiet gesehen werden kann.</p>",

      "name": "Jadren Tagar",
      "appearance": "<p>Jadrens Leben verlief in zwei Akten. Der erste Akt begann in seiner Jugend, als er auf den Straßen des Schlammsuhls, eines Bezirks von Oppara, aufwuchs. Er führte eine Bande von Jugendlichen an, aus der schon bald eine Gilde von Taschendieben und Kleinkriminellen wurde. Jahre später wurde die Hälfte seiner Bande von Gesetzeshütern eingebuchtet und Jadren war sich sicher, dass seine Kumpane ihn als ihren Anführer verpfeifen würden. Noch am Abend floh er aus der Stadt und ließ den einzigen Ort, den er je als sein Zuhause angesehen hatte, hinter sich. Monatelang zog er von Hafen zu Hafen, trank und feierte, bis er eines Morgens aufwachte und feststellen musste, dass er sich der Mannschaft des Piratenschiffes Messingvogel angeschlossen hatte.</p>\n<p>Zuerst zeigte sich, dass er fürs Segeln keinerlei Talent hatte, doch wie die Jahre vergingen, erlernte er, nahezu jede Rolle an Bord eines Schiffs zu füllen, vom Smutje bis hin zum Bootsmann. Jadren erwies sich stets als Stimmungskanone und erzählte gerne verschrobene und lachhafte Geschichten aus seiner Jugend. Dies führte dazu, dass Kapitän Renlock besonderen Gefallen an ihm fand. Nach ein paar guten Jahren beförderte der Kapitän ihn zum ersten Maat. Und dann begann alles schiefzugehen.</p>\n<p>Nachdem sie ein varisisches Handessschiff verfolgt und gestellt hatte, enterte die Mannschaft das Schiff auf der Suche nach Beute. Sie nahmen mit, was sie an Ladung finden konnten und der Kapitän entschied sich, Schiff und Besatzung ziehen zu lassen. Doch eine Hexe an Bord nahm Anstoß an dem Raub und verfluchte die Messingvogel und ihre Mannschaft. Keine zwei Tage später suchten Stürme und ungünstige Winde das Schiff heim. Eine Woche später wurde die Messingvogel letztendlich von der andoranischen Marine aufgespürt. Tagelang segelte Jadrens Mannschaft nach Süden, um zurück zu den Fesseln zu gelangen. Doch die andoranische Marine verfolgte sie unerbittlich. Kapitän Renlock versuchte, das Schiff in seinen geheimen Hafen auf einer kleinen Insel nördlich des Archipels zu fahren, doch die Winde waren gegen ihn. Nach einer offenen Schlacht, in der Jadren schwer verwundet wurde, kapitulierte Kapitän Renlock. Und so endete der erste Akt von Jadrens Leben.</p>\n<p>Das erste, an das Jadren sich nach der Schlacht erinnerte, war, dass er in einem Tempel der Iomedae in Andoran wieder erwachte. Die Priester dort versorgten seine Wunden und richteten seine Knochen. Es war eine langwierige Gesundung - eine, von der die Priester wollten, dass er sie allein für sich erreicht, ohne die Hilfe von Magie, auf dass ihm der ganze Preis des von ihm gewählten Lebens bewusst werden möge. Nach Wochen der Heilung stellten ihn die Priester vor die Wahl: Er könnte einige Monate lang seine Strafe im Gefängnis absitzen oder aber bei ihnen bleiben und Buße tun, indem er im Tempel hilft und sich um die Bedürftigen kümmert.</p>\n<p>Das klang besser als eine Gefängniszelle und so erklärte Jadren sich einverstanden. In den darauffolgenden Monaten lernte Jadren viel über sich selbst und sann sorgfältig über seine Vergangenheit nach. Sein Leben war bestimmt gewesen von Gier und stets hatte er nur an sich selbst und sein Vergnügen gedacht. Indem er nun anderen half, hatten die Priester ihm den Wert eines Lebens voller Hingabe und Bescheidenheit gezeigt. Darüber hinaus lehrten sie ihn Disziplin und bildeten ihn auch in Kampfkunst aus. Die Lehren der Priester überzeugten Jadren davon, dass er seinem Leben einen größeren Sinn geben könnte, wenn er es in den Dienst der guten Sache stellen würde.</p>\n<p>Als die Zeit kam, den Tempel zu verlassen, bat Jadren darum, bleiben zu dürfen und begann eine Ausbildung als Streiter des Glaubens.</p>\n<p>Einige Jahre später hat Jadren nun sein Leben völlig verändert. Er ist ein zuverlässiger Krieger im Dienste Iomedaes und bereit sein Leben für andere zu geben. Besonders liegt ihm daran, denjenigen, die ein Leben als Verbrecher gewählt haben, zu helfen, dies - so wie er selbst - als Fehler zu erkennen. Leider kommt diese Erkenntnis zu spät für seinen alten Freund und Mentor Kapitän Renlock. Gestern erst erreichte Krählo, der berühmte mechanische Papagei des Kapitäns, den Tempel, um Jadren die Botschaft vom Tod seines Herrn zu überbringen. Darüber hinaus brachte Krählo auch ein rätselhaftes Anliegen mit.</p>\n<p><strong>Ziele:</strong> Jadren ist stets bemüht, Buße zu tun für das Leid, das er in seinem früheren Leben verursacht hat. Nichts würde er lieber tun, als dies ungeschehen zu machen, auch wenn dies doch höchstwahrscheinlich unmöglich ist. Er weiß, dass er sich vielleicht nie rehabilitieren kann, aber dennoch widmet er sich ganz seiner Aufgabe, die Welt zu verbessern.</p>\n<p><strong>Persönlichkeit:</strong> Jadren ist warmherzig und freundlich, vielleicht sogar im Übermaß. Früher war sei Gebaren von derbem Humor und mitreißenden Trinksprüchen geprägt, heute dagegen sind es mehr Predigten oder Parabeln über Iomedae. Wer ihn kennt, kann sich sein früheres Leben kaum vorstellen. Gleichermaßen wäre jemand aus seinem alten Leben vermutlich schockiert, ihn heute zu sehen.</p>\n<p><strong>Beziehungen:</strong> Gläubige schätzen Jadren und seine Hingabe zu Iomedaes Lehren sehr. Auf Außenstehende kann er allerdings moralisierend und selbstgerecht wirken.</p>",

For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1* </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1* </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

Sie wurde unter verheißungsvollen Sternen geboren und so benannten ihre Eltern sie als Unglücksfresserin - jemand, der das Unglück, das die Besatzung eines Schiffs befallen könnte, verzehrt und ihr Glück bringt. Wie zu erwarten, fand die Besatzung schnell Gefallen an ihren schelmischen Eskapaden. Kaako wuchs an Bord eines Schiffes auf und lernte in den Jahren ihrer Entwicklung viele Leute aus aller Welt kennen, während sie die Küsten von Avistan und Garund hinauf und hinab segelte. Dies war eine schöne Zeit für sie, und sie denkt gerne voller Nostalgie daran zurück.</p>\n<p>Jahre später verließ Kaako ihre Eltern, um sich der Mannschaft von Kapitän Renlock an Bord der Messingvogel anzuschließen. Dort war sie einige Zeit glücklich. Die Mannschaft der Messingvogel machte sich einen Namen als Piraten eines der gefürchtetsten Schiffe, das vor den Küsten segelte. Als die Messingvogel vor der varisischen Küste ein kleines Handelsschiff aufbrachte, traf Kaako auf ein Unglück, welches selbst sie nicht verhindern konnte. Die Mannschaft der Messingvogel überfiel dieses Schiff - nicht mit der Absicht, es zu kapern oder Geiseln zu nehmen, sondern um Wertsachen zu rauben und es dann fahren zu lassen. Eine Passagierin des Schiffs - eine Hexe aus Varisia - nahm allerdings Anstoß an dem Raub und belegte die Messingvogel und ihre Mannschaft mit einem Fluch. Nach diesem verhängnisvollen Tag wurde das Schiff ständig von Stürmen und ungünstigen Winden heimgesucht. Immer wieder geriet die Messingvogel ins Visier der ein oder anderen Marine, die bereit gewesen wäre, sie aufzugreifen. All dies führte schließlich zu der schicksalhaften Begegnung mit der Marine von Andoran. Diese jagte die Messingvogel bis in die Fesseln und konnte ihre Mannschaft schließlich überwältigen. Um weiteres Blutvergießen zu vermeiden, kapitulierte Kapitän Renlock und die Mannschaft der Messingvogel zersprengte.</p>\n<p>Kaako wurde glücklicherweise nach nur wenigen Monaten wieder freigelassen und konnte zu einem Leben auf dem offenen Meer zurückkehren. Sie schloss sich den Mannschaften anderer Schiffe an, fühlte sich aber dort niemals wieder zu Hause. Fünf Jahre später erfreut sie sich noch immer am Piratenleben, doch bereitet es ihr mehr und mehr Verdruss, die Taschen anderer mit Gold zu füllen, während für sie selbst nur wenig abfällt.</p>\n<p>Doch dann erreichte sie die Nachricht, dass Kapitän Renlock im Gefängnis gestorben war. Sein mysteriöser mechanischer Papagei Krählo tauchte vor dem Fenster von Kaakos Kabine auf, um eine Botschaft zu überbringen.</p>\n<p><strong>Ziele:</strong> Kaako träumt von einer Zukunft, in der sie Kapitänin ihres eigenen Schiffes ist oder zumindest eine Mannschaft findet, die sie als Familie bezeichnen könnte.</p>\n<p><strong>Persönlichkeit:</strong> Kaako ist neugierig, aber leicht zu erschrecken. Sie hat ein Faible für farbenprächtige Kleidung und schmückt sich gerne mit glänzendem Tand und Anhängern, von denen sie behauptet, sie würden dabei helfen, böse Geister und Flüche fernzuhalten. Tatsächlich aber gefällt ihr einfach, wie dieser Schmuck aussieht. Kaako ist sich nicht zu schade, ihre „mystischen“ Verbindungen hochzuspielen, auch wenn sie in Wahrheit kaum einen Einfluss auf solche Dinge hat. Unter Freunden ist sie jedoch viel gelassener und betätigt sich gerne als Faxenmacherin.</p>\n<p><strong>Beziehungen:</strong> Die meisten sehen Kaako als seltsame, mysteriöse Gestalt mit vielen Geheimnissen. Daher versuchen nur wenige, ihr näherzukommen. Wer die junge Tengu aber besser kennt, weiß, dass sie eine warmherzige Freundin sein kann, auch wenn sie in Gesellschaft anderer Humanoiden oft etwas unbeholfen wirkt.</p>",

Any of these spells that aren't normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you prepare them this way.</p>\n<h2>Sanctification</h2>\n<p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This gives you the holy or unholy trait, which commits you to one side of a struggle over the souls of the planes and may be referenced in other abilities. If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy you gain the trait automatically. If you gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you complete an atone ritual.</p>\n<h2>Anathema</h2>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Casting spells with the unholy trait is almost always anathema to deities who don't allow unholy sanctification, and casting holy spells is likewise anathema to those who don't allow holy sanctification. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all cleric spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual.</p>"

As a cleric, your chants generally invoke your deity and their powerful servants by name or title, while your gestures are followed by sacred symbols or other representations of your deity.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell.

The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in Cleric Spells per Day table above.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or for your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of cleric spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>"

      "name": "Lavanna Salzschaum",
      "appearance": "<p>Lavanna kann sich an keine Zeit erinnern, die sie nicht an Bord eines Schiffes verbracht hätte. Sie wurde schon sehr jung von ihrem chelischen Herrn an den Kapitän eines Handelsschiffs verkauft. Schon bald darauf fand sie ihre Freiheit auf dem offenen Meer und stieg in der Rangfolge der Mannschaft der Silbernen Tänzerin auf, dem ersten Schiff, auf dem sie je Mitglied einer Mannschaft war. Eines Abends erwischte ein besonders furchterregender Sturm Lavanna an Deck, jedoch wurde sie nicht umhergewirbelt oder gar über Bord gespült - nein, sie fand Frieden in dem tosenden Wind und spürte die Anmut der beißenden Wellen, die über sie hinweg spülten. Dies war das erste Mal, dass sie die Stimme Gozrehs vernahm und erkannte, dass in ihren Adern das Blut der Undinen floss.</p>\n<p>Lavannas Ausbildung war alles andere als traditionsgemäß. In jedem Hafen, in dem ihr Schiff anlegte, erlernte sie, was sie nur konnte, über den Glauben Gozrehs, während sie andererseits ihren Pflichten an Bord des Handelsschiffes nachging. Mit der Zeit wurde zu einer versierten Heilerin und übernahm diese Aufgabe auf der Silbernen Tänzerin. Ein Jahr darauf wurde ihr Talent auf die Probe gestellt, als an Bord ein schreckliches Feuer ausbrach und das Schiff zu sinken begann. Nur Dank Lavannas Fähigkeiten konnten Mitglieder der Mannschaft diese Katastrophe überhaupt überleben. Glücklicherweise wurde ihr Schiff von der Messingvogel entdeckt, einem Piratenschiff von gewissem Ruhm. Kapitän Renlock hatte Mitleid mit den armen Seelen der Silbernen Tänzerin, nahm sie an Bord und setzte sie im nächsten Hafen ab.</p>\n<p>Lavanna entschied sich, an Bord der Messingvogel zu bleiben, um die Mannschaft dort zu versorgen und sicherzustellen, dass das Schiff die Meere mit Gozrehs Segen befuhr. Auch wenn das Piratenleben ihr nie richtig passte, fand sie doch Gefallen am Leben an Bord der Messingvogel, da sie herausfand, dass sie vieles mit den anderen Mitgliedern der Mannschaft verband - allesamt Ausgestoßene und Wanderer, die ihr Leben nach eigener Wahl führten. Für eine Weile war dies genug.</p>\n<p>Doch Ärger fand die Messingvogel, als ihre Mannschaft vor der Küste Varisias ein kleines Handelsschiff enterte. Nachdem sie das Schiff um seine Wertsachen erleichtert hatte, ließ Kapitän Renlock dessen Besatzung laufen. Eine Hexe jedoch nahm Anstoß an dem Raub und belegte die Messingvogel und ihre Mannschaft mit einem Fluch. Schreckliche Stürme suchten darauf Schiff und Mannschaft heim. Lavanna konnte noch so viel zu Gozreh beten, das Meer beruhigte sich nicht. Schlimmer gar, die Marine von Andoran nahm die Spur der Messingvogel auf und verfolgte sie auf Schritt und Tritt.</p>\nNach einer offenen Schlacht gab Kapitän Renlock das Schiff schließlich auf und die kleine Familie, die Lavanna zu schätzen gelernt hatte, wurde auseinandergerissen. <p>Zum Glück fand die Halblingin nach nur wenigen Monaten im Gefängnis schon bald ihrer Freiheit wieder. Auf dem Weg hinunter zum Hafen stieß sie auf ihren alten Kapitän, dem sie einst vor all den Jahren das Leben gerettet hatte. Keine zwei Tage später stieß sie wieder in See, diesmal an Bord der Silbernen Tänzerin II. Die letzten fünf Jahre vergingen zumeist friedlich und brachten Wohlstand. Lavanna hat es sich dort gemütlich gemacht, doch mit dieser Gemütlichkeit kamen ihr auch Zweifel. Sich um die Mannschaft zu sorgen ist zwar eine wichtige Arbeit, doch manchmal fragt Lavanna sich, ob die Bequemlichkeit und der Tagesablauf, wie sie sie an Bord des Schiffs genießt, sich mit den Grundsätzen ihrer Gottheit vertragen.</p>\n<p>Doch diese Gedanken müssen nun warten, denn die Nachricht, dass Kapitän Renlock im Gefängnis gestorben ist, hat nun Lavanna erreicht. Merkwürdigerweise wurde diese Botschaft von seinem kuriosen mechanischen Papagei Krählo überbracht.</p>\n<p><strong>Ziele:</strong> Lavanna hat erkannt, dass sie an einem Scheideweg angekommen ist und sich entscheiden muss, ob sie ihr bequemes Leben aufgeben will oder nicht. Ihre Wanderlust wächst von Tag zu Tag und könnte sie schon bald überwältigen. Sie will so dringend wieder hinaus auf die offene See und neue Meere befahren, neue Leute kennenlernen und all die Dinge sehen, die Gozrehs Freigiebigkeit gespendet hat.</p>\n<p><strong>Persönlichkeit:</strong> Lavanna ist ein wenig in ihrem Alltagstrott gefangen. Sie sehnt sich nach dem offenen Meer, danach, der See und den Stürmen zu trotzen, ins Unbekannte zu segeln und all die Schätze der Natur zu bewundern. Doch die Jahre an Bord eines Handelsschiffs haben sie unglücklicherweise schwach und selbstgefällig werden lassen. Die Besatzung der Silbernen Tänzerin II neigt dazu, lieber auf Nummer Sicher zu gehen und bei gefährlicher Witterung nah am Ufer zu segeln und stets nur auf den vorgeschriebenen Schifffahrtswegen zu reisen. Lavanna sieht zwar ihr Aufgabe, sich um die Besatzung zu kümmern, als wichtig an, doch der Mangel an Gefahren in ihren täglichen Aufgaben langweilt sie immer wieder. Die Natur fasziniert Lavanna weiterhin, ganz besonders der Ozean und die Kreaturen, die ihn bewohnen. Sie ist oft still, doch wenn es ums Meer geht, kommen viele andere kaum zu Wort bei ihren wilden Vorträgen.</p>\n<p><strong>Beziehungen:</strong> Früher hatte Lavanna durchaus etwas Wildes an sich. Sie sprach gerne dem Grog zu und sang mit dem Rest der Mannschaft Seemannslieder. Heute ist sie jedoch in einem Maße beständig geworden, dass die Besatzung der Silbernen Tänzerin II sie als Langweilerin ansieht.</p>",

Chromatic dragons tend to be evil, and metallic dragons tend to be good.</p>\n<h2>Table 3-4: Dragon Instincts</h2>\n<table class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Dragon</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Breath Weapon</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Black</td>\n<td>Chromatic</td>\n<td>Line of Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>Chromatic</td>\n<td>Line of Electricity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td>Chromatic</td>\n<td>Cone of Poison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Red</td>\n<td>Chromatic</td>\n<td>Cone of Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>White</td>\n<td>Chromatic</td>\n<td>Cone of Cold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass</td>\n<td>Metallic</td>\n<td>Line of Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bronze</td>\n<td>Metallic</td>\n<td>Line of Electricity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Copper</td>\n<td>Metallic</td>\n<td>Line of Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gold</td>\n<td>Metallic</td>\n<td>Cone of Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Silver</td>\n<td>Metallic</td>\n<td>Cone of Cold</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Anathema</h2>\n<p>Letting a personal insult against you slide is anathema to your instinct. Choose whether your character respects or abhors your dragon type. If you respect it, defying such a dragon is anathema, and if you abhor it, failing to defeat such a dragon you come across is anathema.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Draconic Rage (Instinct Ability)</h2>\n<p>While raging, you can increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 4 and change its damage type to match that of your dragon's breath weapon instead of the damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack.

If you have greater weapon specialization, instead increase the damage from Rage when using draconic rage from 8 to 16.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Raging Resistance<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You resist piercing damage and the damage type of your dragon's breath weapon.</p>"

Auch wenn sie sich auf der Suche nach Hilfe zuerst an Autoritätspersonen wandte, fand sie auf die harte Weise heraus, dass eine Gesellschaft, die Ordnung und Konformität über alles stellt, nur wenig zur Unterstützung der Ausgestoßenen unternimmt. Oft genug geriet Quizrel in weit ärgere Bedrängnis dadurch Opfer zu sein, als diejenigen, welche sie erst zum Opfer gemacht hatten. Schlussendlich entschied sich Quizrel für eine andere Herangehensweise. Das nächste Mal, als sie von einer Gruppe Kobolde mit böswilliger Absicht umzingelt wurde, biss sie dem Anführer der Gruppe in die Nase weigerte sich loszulassen. Natürlich bekam Quizrel auch dafür Ärger, aber die Hänseleien fanden ein Ende.</p>\n<p>Dennoch gefiel Quizrel diese schwer verdiente Lehrstunde nicht und sie sträubte sich, dies wirklich zu akzeptieren. Nachdem sie eine lange Zeit in sich gegangen war, kam sie zu zwei Schlussfolgerungen: Zum einen sollten andere ausgestoßene Kobolde nicht so leiden, wie sie es getan hatte, und zum zweiten mochte Quizrel es nicht, Probleme zu bekommen. Aus diesem Grund begann sie, die Gesetze des Baus zu studieren, die Beschränkungen sowie die Strafen. Sie fand jedes nur mögliche Schlupfloch, damit sie andere Kobolde dazu zwingen konnte, bei Konflikten nach ihrem Willen zu entscheiden. Bewaffnet mit der Macht des Wissens war Quizrel in der Lage, eine bessere Behandlung für die Aussätzigen unter den Kobolden zu erreichen, und erlangte eine selbstzufriedene Genugtuung dadurch, dass die Ranghöheren, die sie selbst ignoriert hatten, nun zur Handlung gezwungen waren. Und immer dann, wenn der Rechtsweg versagte, konnte ein zielgerichteter Hieb mit einem Zimmermannshammer in einem dunklen Tunnel Wunder wirken.</p>\n<p>Quizrels Erfahrungen sorgten dafür, dass sie Regeln und Autorität nicht mehr ernst nimmt, auch wenn sie beides schon zu Ihrem Vorteil hat einsetzen können. Nichts versetzt Quizrel in mehr Verzückung, als etwas Verbotenes zu tun und damit davon zu kommen. Sie ignoriert regelmäßig die Sperrstunde und die verbotenen Bereiche des Baus. Sie schleicht sich an den Wächtern des Baus und den Fallen vorbei, um die verbotenen Bereiche des Untergrundes von Absalom zu erkunden und sich einige Schätze einzustecken, wenn sie denn schon mal da ist. Quizrel möchte schlussendlich an die Oberfläche von Absalom, um dort zwischen den Leuten, den Straßen und den Annehmlichkeiten der Stadt zu wandeln, nur um dann den Weg zurück zu finden und den anderen Kobolden ihre Geschichte zu erzählen und sie mit Ehrfurcht vor Ihren Taten zu erfüllen.</p>",

      "appearance": "<p>Rhin verbrachte seine frühen Tage als Plünderer. Er grub sich durch die zerfallenden Ziegel und die gepresste Erde von Absaloms Unterstadt, stets auf der Suche nach nützlichen Dingen. Als er eines Tages die verschütteten Überreste eines Hauses ausschachtete, konnte Rhin ein nahezu intaktes Kinderbuch bergen. Von den vielen farbigen Bildern fasziniert, blätterte Rhin die Seiten seines neuesten Fundes neugierig durch. Auch wenn das Buch in einer Sprache geschrieben war, die er nicht verstand und die Schrift auch größtenteils unleserlich war, zeigten die Bilder doch eine deutliche Geschichte. Rhin war fasziniert von der Geschichte eines Menschenjungens, welcher mit einem magischen Ring auf waghalsige Abenteuer aufbrach. Der Junge war sogar in der Lage, mit einer speziellen Melodie einen Drachen aus dem Meer zu sich zu rufen. Da Rhin davon überzeugt war, hier ein Geschichtsbuch in Händen zu halten, tat er alles in seiner Macht stehende, um diesem mysteriösen Helden nachzueifern. Er sparte sich Münzen vom Munde ab und sammelte Stoffstreifen, um ein Kleidungsset zu nähen, das dem Jungen der Geschichte entsprach. Ein kupferner Ring, mittlerweile grünlich angelaufen, ziert jetzt einen seiner Finger.</p>\n<p>Indem er die Stellungen und Manöver des Jungen in dem Buch nachahmte, unterzog er sich einem einigermaßen praktischen Grundkurs in der Kampfkunst - auch wenn dieses Buch dafür nicht wirklich der beste Lehrer war - und konnte das Gelernte sogar mit einigem Erfolg anwenden. Doch am meisten wurden die anderen Hakenklauen von Rhins Musik überrascht. Immer wenn Rhin eine bestimmte Melodie spielt, scheint die Magie zu antworten. Rhin glaubt fest daran, dass diese Kraft von einem schlafenden Drachen kommt, welcher unter dem Hafen Absaloms ruht, seiner Okarina in den Träumen zuhört und ihm im Gegenzug magische Macht verleiht. Die anderen Hakenklauen sehen das eher skeptisch, aber keiner kann den Atem lang genug anhalten, um Rhin zu widerlegen. Seine Lieder sind eindeutig effektiv und sogar die pragmatischsten Kobolde müssen zugeben, dass es genauso wahrscheinlich ist, dass diese Kraft von einem versunkenen Drachen kommen kann wie von einem anderen Ort. Rhin sucht in der Hoffnung, dass die richtige Melodie den schlafenden Drachen erwecken wird, stets nach neuer Musik und Inspiration, auf dass er seinen Wohltäter dereinst treffen kann.</p>",

Once your minor curse has manifested, it remains in effect until you rest for 8 hours and again make your daily preparations. If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. The minor effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells, progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When you Refocus while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce your curse's severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point.</p>\n<p>Drawing upon your mystery's power while your curse is at its worst causes an irreconcilable conflict between you and the sources of your power. Immediately after casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can't Cast or Sustain any revelation spells-you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still Refocus to reduce the effects of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn't allow you to cast further revelation spells. These effects last until you rest for 8 hours and make your daily preparations, at which point your curse returns to its basic state. At higher levels, you can grow to withstand your curse's major and even extreme effects, enabling you to cast more revelation spells without becoming overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Your curse has the curse, divine, and necromancy traits. You can't mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your oracular curse by any means other than Refocusing and resting for 8 hours. For example, if your curse makes creatures concealed from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as true strike (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell).

Für viele Jahre sind die Hakenklauen trotz seiner immensen Stärke schier daran verzweifelt, eine passende Aufgabe für ihn innerhalb des Stammes zu finden. Die Kommandeure der Milizen haben ihn herausgeworfen, weil er nicht in der Lage war, auch nur den grundlegendsten Befehlen zu gehorchen. Simiek sollte Fallen wiederaktivieren, aber diese Zeit endete, bevor sie ganz anfing, da er zu nervös war, um den Umgang mit einer Armbrust zu lernen, ohne dabei Unfälle zu verursachen. Schlussendlich wurde der unglückliche Kobold als einfacher Arbeiter eingeteilt und hatte nichts Komplexeres zu tun, als schwere Kisten von einem zu einem anderen Ort zu bewegen. Dennoch sollte diese einfache Entscheidung die Geschichte des Hakenklauenstammes drastisch verändern. Als ein blutrünstiger Abenteurer sich an den Fallen der Kobolde vorbeigestohlen hatte und in den Bau einbrach, war Simiek in der Nähe am Arbeiten. Dieses eine Mal reagierte der Kobold trotz seiner Panik tapfer und schlug den Abenteurer immer wieder mit einem Fass, bis dieser schlussendlich das Weite suchte.</p>\n<p>Jetzt behandelt der Stamm Simiek wie einen Helden - zumindest solange, bis ihn irgendetwas schlussendlich auffrisst, denn das, so die Kobolde, ist wohl unvermeidbar. Die Hakenklauen haben gemerkt, dass sie gerne einen Helden haben, so dass sie viel Arbeit darin investiert haben, Simiek seinem Titel entsprechend zu trainieren. Simiek konnte sich an unerwarteten Geschenken von Rüstung und Kleidung erfreuen, was es ihm erlaubte, wie einer der strahlende Ritter auszusehen, die er schon als Schlüpfling so bewundert hatte. (Dabei hatte er die Rolle des Ritters in den Geschichten mit Rittern und Drachen eindeutig falsch verstanden - besonders unter Kobolden). Natürlich ist Simiek immer noch ein kompletter hoffnungsloser Fall, so dass die Hakenklauen sicherstellen, dass er immer von einigen Kobolden begleitet wird und nicht schlicht erstarrt und getötet wird.</p>\n<p>Simiek freut sich darüber, dass die anderen Kobolde ihn jetzt mögen, und geht freudig an jeden Ort, den man ihm aufträgt. Er hat seinen Berufswechsel zwar nur durch Glück überlebt, aber manchmal, wenn seine Panik ihn in die richtige Richtung treibt, handelt er wieder wie der Held, für den die anderen ihn so gerne halten. Er hat bewiesen, dass er zu vergesslich ist, um ihn zu überlisten, und zu unschuldig, um ihn zu korrumpieren, was die Hakenklauen nahezu verzweifeln lässt, aber gleichsam auch einen gewissen Besitzstolz mit sich bringt. Schließlich hat Simiek ein Herz aus Gold, metaphorisch gesprochen, und ist damit dichter an Gold dran, als es jeder andere Kobold der Hakenklauen jemals war.</p>",

He abandoned his family and headed south, taking on the solo life of a wilderness hunter, eventually finding his way to the Korvosan hinterlands-and new friends. After spending so long alone in the wilds, he's grown quite fond of his new family. Someday he hopes to bring them back to Tian Xia to show them his homeland, but he's in no rush to return quite yet.</p>\n<p>Takemiru appears as a muscular, fox-like humanoid with red and white fur and bright blue eyes. His choice of weapons remains a playful vex to those who don't know him. Like the three-tined trident and sai he wields, he possesses three long fox tails. The fur on each tail lightens to white at the tip, and occasionally little wisps of smoke waft from the fur at the tip of his central tail as if it were on the verge of catching fire.</p>",

You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h2>Spellbook</h2>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via Learn a Spell.

Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells.

Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank.
