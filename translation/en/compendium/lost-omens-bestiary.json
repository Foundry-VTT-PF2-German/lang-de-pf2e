      "publicNotes": "<p>Aigamuxas are towering humanoids that stalk arid deserts in search of prey. Carnivorous and voracious, they hunt anything that moves but especially relish eating sentient creatures. Many Mwangi people incorrectly refer to aigamuxas as demons, while others more accurately describe them as having descended from giants. Aigamuxas resemble large humans with smooth hollows where their eyes should be, but their eyes are actually embedded in the soles of their feet. They sport long, sharp claws and teeth that they use to tear their prey apart once they catch them. A moving aigamuxa's odd gait resembles dancing more than a typical walk or run, but its speed is alarming, if difficult to correctly estimate at a distance.</p>\n<p>An aigamuxa's unique physiology makes catching prey difficult, and most aigamuxas are constantly hungry. When pursuing prey, an aigamuxa must occasionally stop to lift its feet in order to regain their bearings. Most stand on their hands while looking around, which allows them to immediately backflip back into a run. An aigamuxa's eyes are generally resistant to the sands of their native desert habitats, but irritants such as chilies or caltrops can seriously impair their hunting ability, and desert travelers often carry a bag of these in case they need to deal with an aigamuxa.</p>\n<p>Clever aigamuxas know that attacking wandering prey can be very dangerous, instead using their powerful hands to dig deep into sand dunes or dirt and wait to ambush passersby. Aigamuxas are particularly good at hiding in their home environments, and unfortunate travelers often don't notice the barely visible eyes of an aigamuxa until it's too late.</p>",

Although this large, solitary beast bears a slight resemblance to the common draft ox, it's a highly aggressive and territorial carnivore who stalks and devours its prey. An aoyin dwells high in the mountains, rarely being seen by common folk. However, during lean winters, an aoyin might descend from its mountain home in search of food, resulting in gruesome encounters with nearby settlements. It's believed that a single aoyin can decimate the population of an entire village, only to retreat into the nearby mountains once it has satiated its hunger. An aoyin, even a herd of the creatures, is primarily driven by hunger and other natural urges. Outside of its natural habitat, an aoyin might occasionally be kept by those who revel in bloodlust. Even with magical control, a captive aoyin is more likely to turn on its handlers than obey commands. As an uncontrolled weapon, however, a hungry aoyin poses a terrible threat to most communities. Tales in certain isolated areas claim that the growling call of an aoyin can drive those unlucky enough to hear it into a frenzy of hunger and violence. Villages will be found consumed by infighting without any sign of an aoyin even entering its borders. Although it's possible a powerful variant of this creature might possess this ability, most of these stories are inspired by the terrible magic available to those who understand the aoyin's secrets and are spread when villages collapse through magic compulsions or mundane infighting.</p>",

However, aso berangs aren't simply large and charismatic animals, for many say they're the kings of forest spirits and patrons of guardians. They're often revered as protective entities by those who live outside the woods they guard. These guardians only appear to common folk if the forest they live in is in danger or if they need something. When they do so, aso berangs can appear as large and powerful humans who emanate a regal presence. Aso berangs have wickedly sharp talons that shed regularly, and they're strong enough to climb trees in pursuit of witches who attempt to escape up them. Very often, aso berangs attack visitors whose hearts they deem impure or those they consider as potential threats to their forest.

Unlike mules found elsewhere on Golarion, augdunars are capable of producing offspring—though significantly fewer than ordinary equines. This has led to a steady, but controlled, stock of the creatures, allowing for the population to be selfsustaining. Augdunars are smaller than typical mules to accommodate dwarven height, measuring about four and a half feet tall and weighing between 400 and 600 pounds.</p>\n<p>Because of their ability to carry loads beyond that of the traditional mule, in addition to the ability to breed amongst themselves, augdunars are a frequent target of thieves or opportunistic merchants. No Highhelm citizen worth their stone willingly sells an augdunar to outsiders, so attempted thefts on the road are common. Unfortunately for these robbers, the mules are quite loyal to their owners and bray loudly whenever a stranger handles their leads. Combined with a heavy kick to the skull from the animal, any attempts to make off with an augdunar have low odds of succeeding.</p>\n<p>While rare, small groups of the augdunar have broken away from dwarven control over the years and created feral colonies in the Five Kings Mountains. These colonies are largely safe from ordinary predators, such as wolves, and graze on mountainside plants. Due to their low birthrate, feral augdunars don't need to have their population controlled, though caravanners do attempt to capture and redomesticate them in an effort to increase profit.</p>\n<p>Despite being natural beasts of burden, dwarves don't often use augdunars as mounts. The mules seem to have an instinctive dislike of riders, to which the deep bite marks and hoofprints left in those who try can attest. That's not to say that some haven't succeeded, however. Those who put forth the effort required to create a bond with an augdunar find that their persistence can pay off. Augdunar loyalty is unparalleled and even thieves know to not attempt to steal an augdunar that's carrying a rider.</p>",

When a band of bilokos finds a suitable hunting ground, they claim the area exclusively, digging pit traps, crafting snares from vines, and building blinds high in trees where they can lie in ambush.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Bilokos are crocodile-snouted fey who stalk the Mwangi Jungle and feast upon the flesh of humanoids. As cunning as they are vicious, bilokos employ deadly traps and guerrilla hunting tactics to capture prey-typically hapless explorers or, occasionally, wayward villagers, many of whom believe bilokos to be cruel ancestral spirits. The most powerful of these creatures, known as elokos, wield potent transformative magic.</p>\n<p>Bilokos have a fondness for bells, and the sound of ringing bells often indicates their presence. In addition to carrying and ringing them while out hunting, bilokos sometimes enchant bells with potent magic, or hang them on strings to serve as alarms for their encampments.</p>\n<p>Bilokos look like slender but wiry humanoids with crocodile-like heads, rust-colored skin, and blood-red eyes. They eat only the meat of humanoids, though they can survive for extended periods of time on a single meal thanks to their snakelike ability to consume a Medium humanoid creature whole. They do this by unhinging their jaws and slowly swallowing the victim from head to foot. Thanks to their acidic saliva and sharp teeth, a biloko can masticate their food into an easy-to-digest pulp, grinding flesh and bone into a compact mush, even while swallowing; thus, they do not flinch while devouring meals two or three times their own size.</p>\n<p>A recently-fed biloko can be easily recognized by their sagging, distended belly. However, despite their slow appearance, the fey is no less dangerous then, as they delight in killing and might have hungry comrades hiding nearby, waiting to feed.</p>",

Created by an experimental collaboration between the city's gunsmiths and clockwork inventors, the clockwork cannoneer provides exceptional mobile firepower. Two cannon-arms swing at the sides of the 15-foot-tall automaton, and its body contains a hopper of cannonballs that are replenished by engineers when the creature is wound up for duty. Triple-walled reinforcement on the cannoneer's black-powder reservoirs provides ample protection from the accidental explosions and backfires that often troubled early prototypes of the finely engineered machine. The current design combines the long-range capabilities of field artillery with the stopping power of a firedrake against engaged enemies, and its heat-tempered gear assembly minimizes warping that might cause slipping, grinding, or shaking.</p>\n<p>While reports from living artillery members serving alongside clockwork cannoneers complain of blisters, smoke inhalation, and singed eyebrows, the Grand Duchy's chief clockwork machinists have assured the city's leadership that the constructs function well within safety parameters.

Native to the underground tunnels of the Five Kings Mountains, the reptiles have been domesticated to serve as beasts of burden within the Depths and sprawling web of passages beyond. Zoologists theorize that they are a part of the same reptile family as zetogekis, as the two share a similar build and other physical characteristics.</p>\n<p>Draft lizards within the vicinity of Highhelm have adapted their diet to feed mainly on grindlegrubs. However, residual behavior suggests in lean times or before domestication they would devour stones for sustenance. The animals can still be observed habitually gnawing on boulders or large stones, cracking them with their powerful jaws and seeming to savor the taste as they roll the debris around in their mouths. Overworked draft lizards will stray from their handler's control in order to consume rocks, only to return back to their path with a new undercurrent of purpose.</p>\n<p>Normally as docile as any other beast of burden, the draft lizards of Highhelm will defend themselves if attacked by predators from the Darklands. Curiously, the lizards have an intense hatred for hryngars, attacking them without any prompting or hesitation. No dwarven records indicate teaching this behavior during the domestication of the animals, leaving its origins a mystery. Some caravanners even claim that the reptiles can sense the presence of hryngars, giving advanced warning of attacks by hissing menacingly into the darkness.</p>\n<p>Though too large to be exceptionally dexterous, with careful training some draft lizards can be taught performative tricks. The Rolling Wheel is particularly known for a trio of reptiles that balance on their tails, catch hurled boulders in their jaws, and other stunts. The spectacle is well known in Highhelm, considered one of the big acts that the group performs. This has led to some younger dwarves attempting to teach their animals the same feats, mostly resulting in failure and light property damage in the Depths.</p>",

They do this by unhinging their jaws and slowly swallowing the victim from head to foot.

Every detail of the creature's physiology was fashioned for the battlefield, from the ballista of bone and sinew integrated into its torso to the bulky ram on the crest of its head. The fleshforged's acidic blood not only serves an important hydraulic function but also deters city defenders who might attempt to strike down the creature.</p>\n<p>During the war between Nex and Geb, fleshforged dreadnoughts most often appeared as part of a coordinated assault and typically replaced or augmented an army's compliment of siege weaponry. Common tactics employed by Nex's generals would direct the dreadnought to crush all opposition standing in front of a city's gate and then smash through it. Should the city's defenses prove resilient, invading troops would scale the creature to get over the city walls, relying on the dreadnought's regenerative properties to ensure it wouldn't be destroyed while helping them bypass the defensive barriers.</p>\n<p>Fleshforged dreadnoughts all but vanished after the disappearance of the archmage Nex, but tales of their destructive power have been preserved.</p>",

Imugi strongly prefer long-finned koi, and Tian koi farmers have learned to keep a separate pool of these butterfly koi away from the others they tend, as imugi tend to displace quite a bit of water—and koi—when swooping down to snatch an egg they want.</p>\n<p>Though imugi have some power over rain and storms, most aren't powerful enough to exact a true sense of weather control. Many are known for their benevolence, and some villages even rely on imugi's forays out of streams or lakes, bringing rains during the growing season. Imugi have as wide a range of temperaments as the dragons they become, and some are notorious for how their impatience twists into a foul temper or an arrogance that flicks people aside as if they were bugs. While some might consider mean-spirited imugi corrupted and claim they can be purified somehow, imugi simply hold themselves higher than the average creature and see no reason to conceal their true nature from someone they see as beneath them.</p>",

Characters exposed to this burst might find their minds filled with lost techniques or abilities that the imugi has encountered over its long life, allowing them to gain access to uncommon or rare character options, suddenly understand formulas to craft items, or immediately retrain along a new path</p>",

True or not, jiidons are seemingly normal rats who share the blessing from this story. It's unclear where the first jiidon was born because their descendants live among rat and humanoid populations around the world. In their original forms, jiidons are extremely difficult to distinguish from an ordinary rat and often even finds a home leading its non-sapient kin.</p>\n<p>After eating the discarded fingernails of a humanoid, however, a jiidon can assume the shape of the clippings' owner, resembling the subject in all of the obvious and superficial ways, with several subtle differences. Their ears are a little larger and sometimes come to a small point. Their teeth continue to grow for their entire lifetimes, so they must regularly chew on stones, bark, and other hard materials to file their teeth down and conceal their true nature. The whiskers that grow from the sides of their faces also require daily trimming.</p>\n<p>Jiidons are mostly harmless, but their powers provoke alarm among those who know of them. Mothers scold their children not to clip their nails after nightfall, lest a lurking jiidon seize a sliver that got lost in the dark. Though as cautious as any rat, most jiidons want nothing more than to transform and take a place in humanoid society. In order to reduce suspicion, they've been known to target those who are unpopular among their neighbors. The gratitude they feel when they do replace a humanoid can sometimes be seen in their actions, revealing the fact that the target has been replaced or endearing jiidons to those who didn't appreciate the original's attitude.</p>\n<p>Jiidons from large families will often seek a role that grants them access to nail trimmings, such as a cleaner or doctor, and pass the gift of humanoid form through the family.</p>",

They are extremely dexterous, able to perform complex tasks with only a single hand. The nature of their missing half has so far defied explanation; it is not invisible, nor does it exist on another plane, yet it seems to exert enough force for a k'nonna to walk like a human being.</p>\n<p>No one is certain of the k'nonna's origins, except that they are not of this world and not descended from any known mortal creature. Banishment magic has no effect on them, implying they do not come from another plane. They are intelligent but difficult to communicate with-they speak only in half words and hear only half of what anyone says. K'nonna are also much less interested in talking than eating, and humanoids happen to be their favorite meal.

No matter how careful the residents of Riverton are with their youth and the vulnerable, the Kallas Devil claims her chosen target more often than not, luring the hapless victim toward doom while wearing a smiling child's face.</p>",

The fell purpose of this is still a mystery, though most believe that karinas make off with these dead bodies to consume them in the safety of their lairs. The difficulty of tracking the beasts, as well as the danger, makes it difficult to know for sure.</p>\n<p>A karina's terrifying appearance suggests that they're not natural creatures. Many legends claim that karinas first flew out of Abaddon to the Material Plane to consume the corpses of the first mortals, while others state that the first karina was born from the soul of the first mortal who partook in cannibalism. The power of good repulses karinas, suggesting an evil or fiendish origin.</p>\n<p>Karinas are plague carriers and intentionally attack creatures to spread their own personal pestilence. The supernatural disease they carry, known as grave blight, causes fever, disorientation, and (at later stages) an innate desire to attack others and spread the disease. Karinas revel in the slow collapse of villages, lurking in the surrounding jungle to observe every miserable moment. As the locals bury their dead, the karinas swoop in to steal the corpses.</p>\n<p>In addition to carrying a terrible disease, karinas also have the ability to mimic voices. They typically repeat phrases they've heard, but twist the voice into a fiendish corruption of the original. Intelligent enough to recognize the friends and family of a possible target, a karina will use the mocking voice of a loved one to frighten them.

A kasesh named \"Home\" or \"Sorrow\" has a far more complex psyche, and rumor claims that Elder Architect Oblosk of Nex bears the word \"Memory.\" Unsurprisingly, many scholars are highly interested in the words on the kaseshi; unlike Thassilonian rune magic, no one has managed to decode or make use of the language of the Vault Builders yet.</p>\n<p>The kasesh in the stat block bears the word \"Stone,\" but other kaseshi will have their own magics.

The size and number of their horns vary. Kashrishi communities are generally quite welcoming to others, enjoying the conversation and unique auras of every new stranger. However, chaotic environments can overwhelm and overstimulate kashrishi not yet adept at filtering psychic energies, leaving some with limited tolerance for extensive social interaction with strangers and requiring they take periods of time to refocus after socializing.

      "publicNotes": "<p>Krampus is a tall, goatlike humanoid with a pointed nose, swept-back horns, and hooved feet. His long, greasy tongue continually flickers out from his mouth, occasionally licking droplets of spittle from his dark brown fur. He wields a set of iron chains that act as an extension of his will. Krampus is never seen without a wicker basket draped over one shoulder, its bottom often stained with the blood of his victims. Krampus stands a little over 14 feet tall and weighs nearly 1,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Krampus's origin is unknown; residents of the small towns and villages he terrorizes in northern Irrisen believe the creature has always existed, coming forth once a year to punish those he deems wicked. While many legends have been told about Krampus's beginning, the most popular of them starts with a handful of mountain towns under the protection of a circle of druids. After a series of harsh winters that the townsfolk barely survived, they began to doubt the power of the druids and their rituals. As the villagers grew more resentful, the druid circle took drastic action. Under the light of a blue moon, the druids opened an imperfect portal to the primal realm of the fey and called forth the most powerful spiritual essence they could, and a new creature was born-Krampus. However, unknown to the druids, the portal had been corrupted by the villagers' bitter resentment and doubt. Instead of a central figure to lead them in winter celebrations, as they had hoped, the druids had spawned a monster who sought to punish those who had behaved selfishly during lean times.</p>\n<p>Recognizing their error, the druids sought to banish their creation. They tracked Krampus down as he slept and shackled him in cold iron chains, hoping to subdue him and force him back to the First World. But Krampus was no fey, and cold iron held no power over him. When he awoke, he ripped the chains free, claimed them as his own, and tracked down the druids who had dared try to capture him. After their betrayal, Krampus can see no good in any mortal and longs only to punish the wicked for their selfish misdeeds.</p>\n<p>To this day, Krampus takes vicious delight in transforming his victims into the petulant children before killing them, and no manner of sacrifice can appease him. Luckily for any nearby villages, Krampus stalks their streets but once a year.</p>\n<p>Locals believe that Krampus makes his lair among the deep crevasses of ice somewhere within the Winterwall Glacier, which lines Avistan's northernmost reaches. No adventurer has yet braved the treacherous expanse to find and defeat him.</p>\n<p>While Krampus is most infamous for tracking and punishing the naughty, his own sins often inform his vindictive responses to others' misdeeds. An incarnation of Krampus who arose from irrepressible greed might possess abilities that better reflect his fierce miserly behavior, emphasizing less the abduction of miscreants and more the disproportionate punishment of thieves and robbers. Such a variant Krampus might arise in different cultures that tell different stories about Krampus, or Krampus's powers and nature might drift between incarnations each time he is defeated and arises anew elsewhere in the world the following year. In these cultures or incarnations, Krampus represents a remorseless yet generous spirit who's willing to grant boons to the truly worthy while tormenting any who fail his morality tests.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for people in regions terrorized by this Krampus, his definition of \"any who fail his morality tests\" tend to be nearly everyone but the most innocent and generous of people.</p>",

Despite its glistening and putrid appearance, it isn't undead, nor does it leave any trace of blood or gristle in its wake. Those who believe its condition might slow it down are often shocked by the creature's jittering speed, and those who believe they might be able to track it by the scent of rotting flesh find themselves inhaling the beast's deadly, exhausting spores instead.</p>\n<p>When encountering another creature, Kuworsys doesn't approach initially, instead observing the stranger while hidden or at a distance. While it might grow bolder and approach to examine or provoke another being, it prefers to avoid direct confrontation and is intelligent and stealthy enough to deftly avoid discovery. Its presence proves deadly enough, even without any further aggression, as those who Kuworsys stalks eventually succumb to a lethal lethargy.</p>",

An acrid stench of burning manure follows the creature, often serving as the only warning that anyone gets before it attacks.</p>\n<p>Despite their fungal nature, Melfesh Monsters are undamaged by their own jets of flame and resistant to fires set by others, often surprising hunters who paid too little attention to the legends before encountering the creature. Their terrifying spores also mean that most survivors of their attacks tend to be disoriented and delirious, relating accounts of the monster that are distorted by confusion and fear. This, along with the natural variance between different Melfesh Monsters, means that even the most diligent of researchers will come across contradictory evidence. Even if they learn from all the prior information collected over the years, they're still often caught off guard when trying to hunt down and fell the threat since the new Melfesh Monster might have an ability never seen before. The canniest researchers, when faced with the seemingly contradictory evidence, speculate that the creature might evolve or change over time, which is closer to the truth but still falls short.</p>",

Its heavenly origins and love of wealth may be the reason why imperial dragons have cared for them since time immemorial, valuing them as guardians and loyal companions. In particular, underworld dragons employ pixius to expand their hoards, and many sovereign dragons value them as status symbols. In dragon-ruled realms across Tian Xia, the presence of a pixiu within a community is seen as a sign of its draconic patron's approval and goodwill.</p>\n<p>Despite the protection of imperial dragons, the lure of wealth is still enough to drive some to attack a pixiu.

The difference lies in understanding the original ratajin characteristics. No curse gave ratajin four eyes on a slender face, nor triple-jointed, hypermobile legs and multiple arms. Nor did curses provide ratajin with skin tones of all hues within the color spectrum. Instead, these residual curses have given each ratajin distinctive geometric markings all across their body. Every ratajin also experiences a cursed twist on their senses, altering how they view and interact with the world around them. Some ratajin visualize the world in shifted, indescribable color spectra. For others, sounds physically manifest as feelings on their skin. Haunting melodies of past actions might whisper in the wind behind one ratajin, while another can be awake only during hours devoid of sunlight.</p>\n<p>While particular curse manifestations are passed along family lines, each ratajin's worldview can offer a unique perspective. Ratajin tend to be receptive to new ideas, making them well-suited to tackle complex situations. They often prefer to focus on difficult problems, working without rest until they reach a solution. What satisfies the definition of a worthy pursuit varies with individual ratajin, from tinkering with new applications of technology to uncovering secrets of centuries-old magical tomes. Their intellectual approach to problems can make ratajin especially useful in situations requiring delicate words, and their quick thinking serves them well as adventurers when the time comes for action. These same characteristics also make them capable merchants and scholars.</p>\n<p>Earning a ratajin's trust can prove difficult. Their large-scale communities often collaborate to devise clever solutions that ensure equitable treatment among people, but each community varies greatly due to the different needs of the inhabitants. Outsiders who require too much help too quickly might cause a ratajin to withdraw, believing their guest incapable of adjusting to life's many hurdles. Poorly chosen words of pity or meaningless sympathy toward the nature of a ratajin's unique sensory experience can also cause lingering resentment.</p>",

They have thin, almost-skeletal bodies with strong rear legs that resemble a bear's, front legs like a badger's, and a head like a hare's with humanoid ears. A rompo tends to be timid on its own; it avoids other creatures and typically flees in the presence of larger animals. Though no more intelligent than any other beast, it usually acts with extreme paranoia, dodging traps or ambushes with an uncanny acumen. When danger is present, a rompo utters a loud cry to afford itself space to run and hides by using its body's natural color-shifting fur as camouflage.</p>\n<p>Although rompos sport the perfect physical features to act as predators, they tend to live their lives as solitary scavengers of leftover corpses. Rompos prefer to avoid hunting for themselves since they risk sustaining injuries in the process. It's not uncommon for rompos to follow other predators for hours, waiting for an opportunity to feast on the leftover remains of a hunt.</p>\n<p>Once a rompo gains access to a meal, it takes several minutes circling the corpse to make sure the area is clear. As it begins to feast, it lets out a whimpering cry that fascinates and compels other creatures to keep away so that the rompo can feed in peace. Due to its constant feeding on decaying flesh, a rompo's mouth is filled with rot, parasites, and deadly pathogens. Its bite can impart these combined infections as a dangerous disease known as rompo chills. The disease causes its victim to tremble uncontrollably, lightly at first but eventually developing into a violent shaking that ends with the victim's death. Despite their cautious nature, rompos always seem to linger close to creatures they infect with rompo chills; though they remain unseen while the victim lives, they emerge when that victim finally succumbs, in order to feed on the corpse.</p>",

Skinskitters, named for their fluid, erratic movements, scavenge the city for leavings of fleshy waste. They prefer discreet, non-violent ways of procuring these biological materials and shy from combat, seemingly possessed of a nervous temperament. Nexian fleshforgers quip this is entirely reasonable, as skinskitters are little more than nervous systems wrapped in dying skin. Nexian guards who actually have to hunt these fleshforged pests aren't quite as jocular; confronted by the oddly childlike pleas of these cornered puddles of flesh, hair, and eyes, many recruits simply choose to leave the city watch.</p>\n<p>On occasion, curious scholars or soldiers have questioned why skinskitters pursue organic tissue, and whether this is a simple instinct or in pursuit of a grander purpose. Most fleshforgers assume that skinskitters consume organic matter to repair themselves in a process similar to eating, and give the matter no further thought, showing no more interest in the creatures than a smith might show in a bead of melted slag. The most paranoid Nexians claim that skinskitters are attempting to build something out of their collections of cast-off skin, perhaps even reconstructing themselves into fleshforged conformers. There is no recorded evidence of this ever occurring, however—if the creatures have any awareness at all, it's more likely that skinskitters are driven by the basest of instincts to better themselves through the same methods used in their creation but lack the understanding and self-direction to ever succeed.</p>",

The presence of these avatars is often the only way to track these reclusive and solitary creatures. Should the solar ibis choose to appear, these little birds scatter like wild fowl. The sun bird then manifests and bathes the area in a brilliant shower of light that can blind and startle unwary and unprepared creatures in its presence.</p>\n<p>The solar ibis appears as a magnificent, large bird surrounded by a halo of brilliant light. Its black feathers shimmer with all the colors of the spectrum, casting glossy rainbows across its plumage. It has a keen sense of insight, which it uses to pass judgment as a whole on whether those before it are worthy to access what it guards. It punishes those it finds unworthy with its cleansing might.</p>\n<p>Though considered sacred by most within the Mwangi Expanse, there are still some who hunt these glorious creatures; some seek the treasures that the ibis keep, while others seek the ibis themselves, dead or alive. Some believe that the feathers of a solar ibis, when burned, create an incense that can grant holy power to those that inhale it.

Instead, he's one of a rare type of fey native to the First World who enjoy causing bloody mayhem in the Material Plane. These fey are so rare and so distrustful of one another's company that two have never been seen together; the mistaken assumption that only a single Spring-Heeled Jack exists is therefore entirely understandable. The fact that sightings occur across Ustalav (and beyond) and across centuries of time is ascribed to the trickster's long lifespan and mysterious ability to travel quickly, or to the belief that there's no such creature, merely an urban legend that twisted minds attempt to bring to life through costumes, magic, and a series of murders and mayhem. Even in fear-drenched Ustalav, no one has yet guessed that multiple Spring-Heeled Jacks exist or postulated that some future event might drive them to overcome their mutual disdain and gather into a murderous cabal, far more powerful than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>Spring-Heeled Jacks are cruel-eyed, hairy fey with vaguely humanoid shapes and extra features that cause them to be easily mistaken for demons or devils. Glowing eyes, cloven hooves, menacing horns, and a pointed tail combine to create the mien of a wicked imp; his love of sudden and sadistic violence completes the impression. Almost all have jet-black skin and fur, though a few exceptions might exist.</p>\n<p>Spring-Heeled Jacks typically hide their features in tattered cloaks, appearing as a hunched elder or a youth in the nighttime conditions they enjoy. Such a disguise rarely holds up to any scrutiny, but that doesn't matter much to the Spring-Heeled Jack, who only needs something that offers just enough doubt for their target to move within striking distance, which can be from much farther away than most other creatures even realize. Once close enough, the Spring-Heeled Jack leaps startling distances in the blink of an eye to easily slash at a victim who had, until that moment, considered themself safe.</p>",

The flames and smoke of the cities keeps it at bay, but in the darkness, it is at home. The dwarves of Highhelm have learned how to live with the threat, but those traveling deeper into the mountain must always remain vigilant.</p>\n<p>In the swamps of the Tanglebriar, food is difficult to come by. So when a grievously wounded demon, a shemhazian known as Gratheyr, fled into its waters to escape from his enemies, every starving creature swarmed at the smell of blood. As the creatures devoured his flesh, they were corrupted by his Abyssal blood, and their hunger only grew. They feasted until nothing but his heart remained, still beating at the center of the swarm, binding it to a single will. With its meal finished, the bloated swarm left the swamp in search of its next prey. It moved aimlessly, hunting animals and travelers alike, until a great rumble beneath the earth attracted its attention. The Bloodstorm followed the vibrations deep underground, toward the scent of sweat and the sounds of voices.</p>",

The Great Flood towers with their giant serpent body and nine humanoid heads, each one with a different personality, though all serve the same purpose—to vanquish all signs of life that shouldn't be where they are. This creature intends to maintain the balance of the universe, ensuring that nothing takes up more space than necessary. Unfortunately, the judgment of where someone or something should be is only seen and weighed by the 18 eyes of the Great Flood, with little regard to mortal input.</p>\n<p>The Great Flood is an immortal, or at least ageless, being who hibernates for 12 years at a stretch. On the thirteenth year, they emerge from the depths of the oceans and begin weighing the state of the world and the environments closest to their resting place: should the first thing they see on dry land be destroyed? Each of the Great Flood's nine heads lends their thoughts and insights to this deliberation, and upon reaching a consensus, they'll either carry on to the next location or they'll drown the land, immersing miles of dry land in salty waters from the ocean. In instances where they perceive the excess life as particularly problematic, they'll even decide to poison the waters with their bitter breath to ensure that nothing survives the judgment they've decreed. The Great Flood, despite its inherently destructive nature, isn't actually bloodthirsty and will often afford an opportunity for poor townsfolk to state their case and beg for the lives of their town to be saved. While the Great Flood has the capacity for mercy and consideration, the godlike creature stands adamant once they've made their decision. One or two of the heads might feel a twinge of guilt and tell a small joke to the townsfolk, relieving themselves of the mental pressure, before murdering an entire village.</p>\n<p>The nine personalities of the serpentine creature often run into contention with each other. One is a perfectionist, while another is aloof; one is assertive, while another is playful; one is capricious, while another is suspicious; one is ambitious, while the other is a people pleaser. The last one is quiet and secretive, only ever whispering to the heads closest to them. Though the heads squabble like siblings, they eventually always make a compromise.</p>",
      "privateNotes": "<h3>Passing Judgment</h3>\n<p>There are no exact criteria or written rules that drive the Great Flood's decisions. It's a matter of aesthetics, opinion, and which head ends up leading the discussion. Generally, however, settlements at odds with their natural surroundings will be treated more harshly.</p>\n<h3>A Terrible Sense of Humor</h3>\n<p>A scholar who debated the Great Flood once recorded the following deadpan exchange, serving more as an example of the creature's infamous jokes than providing any actual knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Scholar</strong>: \"What lord or power do you answer to?\"</p>\n<p><strong>The Great Flood</strong>: \"We don't have a lord.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Scholar</strong>: \"Then which of your nine faces is your leader?\"</p>\n<p><strong>The Great Flood</strong>: \"We don't have a leader.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Scholar</strong>: \"Then how do you resolve your disputes?\"</p>\n<p><strong>The Great Flood</strong>: \"We don't have disputes.\"</p>",

Ugvashi first arrived in the Impossible Lands onboard the Thousand and One ships of Maharajah Khiben-Sald, alongside peafowl, giant squirrels, and other fauna from Vudra. In the modern day, ugvashi are such a recognized sight that many people forget they aren't a native species. Though some feral populations exist, mainly on the island of Jalmeray, the hostile environs of Nex and the Mana Wastes mean ugvashi mainly appear in domestic settings, usually as working beasts among the Nearic halflings of western Nex.</p>\n<p>Though ugvashi are mostly harmless, they're somewhat more dangerous than their smaller cousins, causing a stir when reckless citizens attempt to pet the creatures. Ugvashi scales are razor sharp, and their large and blunted digging claws can be deadly due to their size. People who attempt to steal the animals or ride them without training often receive moderate cuts for their trouble. However, ugvashi are generally curious and very friendly, and more than one visitor or wilderness explorer has found a baby ugvashi toddling after them and pawing at their boots.</p>\n<p>Nearic halflings also paint their ugvashi with distinctive warding patterns and sigils, some of which are actually effective and provide a surprise for opportunistic thieves or predators. Though due consideration is spent on protecting an ugvashi's cargo, the animals themselves have proven to be tempting targets as well, especially for their meat. With blighted landscapes making animal husbandry impractical and magical pollution leaving local seafood with a distinct aftertaste, a number of Nexian and Mana Wastes peoples have developed a taste for ugvashi. Since the animals lack an aggressive temperament, it often falls to their caretakers to discourage such predations through whatever means necessary.</p>\n<p>Ugvashi shed their scales each winter, allowing for the plates to be collected safely and turned into quality armor and other pieces of craftwork. Nearic halflings rarely trade or sell these items, however, out of fear that they might lead to more people trying to steal their ugvashi.</p>",

Newborn linnorms remain hidden in their nests for several months as they mature, growing large enough to hunt on their own and setting out into the world. These linnorms are roughly the equivalent of older teenagers when compared to other species. Younger linnorms, while still primal creatures with a strong tie to the First World, haven't yet manifested most of their magical powers. They still can't breathe deadly fire or lightning or see invisible creatures, and, most importantly, they can be slain without prompting the linnorm's legendary death curse. They do, however, have voracious appetites, consuming any living thing to fuel their rapid growth. A linnorm is most vulnerable during this time; scouts who find tracks of a young linnorm quickly muster a hunting party of stalwart and experienced warriors to track the creature down and kill it quickly-before they draw the attention of the linnorm's father.</p>",

There is a high demand for zinbas in many markets; live serpents fetch a hefty sum, but zinba eggs are especially valuable, as zinbas reared in captivity are less willful and more likely to eat in confinement. Their elusiveness, however, leads many to search for their dens instead, which are large pools of water among remote wetlands or underground hollows near bodies of water.
