Animals that die en masse-such as in a tent fire or other disaster-can even form packs of roving undead.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Although the wild creatures seen at traveling circuses can entertain and amaze, the lives of such animals and beasts are sometimes sad and cruel. Circus owners who mistreat their animals through harsh discipline or overtraining see little wrong with their mercilessness, even going so far as to slaughter their entertainers-supposedly \"by accident\"-via neglect or abuse. The victims of such cruelty who cannot move onto the afterlife-either because they somehow become infused with void energy or their spirits cannot rest without first enacting revenge on their assailants-occasionally rise from the dead as visitants.</p>\n<p>These undead monsters haunt the sites of their demise and search out the masters who made their lives so hellish with only one goal in mind: vengeance. When they can't locate their particular abuser, or if they are still unable to rest even after confronting their aggressor, visitants seek out similarly evil harmers of animals, becoming torturers of torturers. However, visitants are for the most part unable to distinguish between individual members of a species; thus, if a visitant was abused by a human trainer, any human that crosses its path may become a target of its rage.</p>\n<p>A visitant resembles a zombified animal, but it retains a spark of the animal intelligence it had in life, making it all the more dangerous as a result. Visitants' bodies are marred by the horrors of their brutal existences: Their mouths are furrowed in a constant snarl, with a black ichor dripping from their cracked, rotten lips. Whip scars from their hours of \"training\" glow with an unnatural purple light. And perhaps above all, their eyes mark them as touched by undeath-sunken horribly deep into their skull, leaking blood or other fluid, and glowing with an aura of dread and palpable anger.</p>",

The trick, of course, is capturing and penning such a specimen. The most reliable means of caging a luminous ooze is with a permanent wall of force shaped into a cube or sphere, but few have the means to create or commission such an enclosure. Instead, most people who find themselves in possession of a luminous ooze simply put it in a thick glass box.

Among the resource-poor xulgaths who dwell in the Darklands, especially those hardy clutches that call the Black Desert their home, obsidian is one of the most common crafting materials available. Combine this ingredient with a powerful spellcaster and the xulgath tradition of inflection-magically warping and working normally inflexible stone-and the end result is an obsidian golem.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

Many shoonies believe that Aroden himself personally created the shoonies after he raised the island from the bottom of the sea, and that he had a deep affinity for their people. Whether or not such tales of companionship with the god of humanity are true, shoonies have drastically declined in numbers since Aroden's death over a hundred years ago. Shoony elders point to strange environmental phenomena around their island home as one cause of their diminishment, and others attribute their decline to the rise of warmongering monsters in the area.

The vast majority of deepmouths worship demon lords, most commonly Zevgavizeb.

They live in simple familial communities, battling rival groups and other aggressive Darklands inhabitants in order to survive. They occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty leaders who are often themselves in the thrall of more powerful creatures like nagas or demons. A typical xulgath has dull gray, dark gray, or ashen scales, with a long tail and bony protrusions that run the length of its spine. A typical xulgath is 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.</p>\n<p>Although today the xulgaths are brutal and scattered, they were one of the first intelligent humanoids to rise in the primeval world, once ruling over a mighty empire that stretched throughout the Darklands. Today, all that remains of this era are ruins of massive stone ziggurats and crumbling cities found within some of the larger caverns. Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins, venerating their ancestors' accomplishments, while others consider these areas taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don't agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell. Some suspect it was the result of a loss of several wars waged against serpentfolk, while others suggest that the corruptive influence of demon worship rotted their culture from within.</p>\n<p>Certainly, many xulgath settlements continue to worship demons to this day, paying homage and offering live sacrifices to terrible creatures from the Abyss. Occasionally, a xulgath shaman can call forth and bind a lesser demon to help serve the group, but a shaman who delves too deep into occultism might summon a more powerful fiend that either tears the xulgaths to pieces or enslaves them.</p>",

You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven't met the target in person, scrying's DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower. The effect of scrying depends on the target's Will save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 week.

Although carnival barkers make any number of claims about this strange being's origins, the so-called \"moon mole\" is in fact an alien creature called a zuipnyrn, hailing from a distant planet beyond Golarion's star system.</p>\n<p>In their infancy, zuipnyrns are spherical and furry, with few features other than a single eye stalk and a round, toothless feeding hole. A zuipnyrn's body is particularly soft and malleable, allowing it to withstand falls and other hazards. Its eye stalk has the ability to produce a blinding burst of light as a defensive measure, which allows a zuipnyrn just enough time to escape in times of danger. Even more incredibly, a zuipnyrn can emit a hypnotic aura from its eye to entrance those around it-an ability it uses to avoid conflict and to persuade bystanders into helping it escape perilous situations. As they age and grow, zuipnyrns adapt to their environment by growing additional limbs, sprouting additional sensory organs, developing gills, or otherwise altering their anatomy to suit the area.</p>",
