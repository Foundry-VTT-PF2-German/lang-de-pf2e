      "publicNotes": "<p>The truth of life in the Universe is that weather controls the world. The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weather—weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>The truth of life in the Universe is that weather controls the world. The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weather—weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weather—weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

While they can be shaped into many forms, most depict muscular warriors with curving horns and stern or taunting expressions. Within each brass shell is a raging inferno—the source of its ceaseless heat.</p>\n<p>Though ifrits originally created brass bastions to act as servants and guards, the knowledge of how to craft them has spread throughout the Plane of Fire. They can even be found on the Plane of Earth thanks to interplanar trade. In Medina Mudii'a, brass bastions walk the streets, tend shops, and stand guard. Bespoke brass bastions are passed down as family heirlooms or gifted to business partners and allies. Scions of the wealthiest ifrit lineages never travel without a train of brass bastions clad in family livery. Destroying a rival ifrit's brass bastion is a quick way to erode their political status, though anyone caught performing such sabotage faces swift retribution.</p>\n<p>Most brass bastions prominently display the sigil of their owner or maker, though magical methods can also determine who crafted a specific construct. Brass bastions forged by favored artisans are a status symbol in many ifrit communities. Ifrits consider a brass bastion crafted by a non-ifrit to be inherently inferior, barely worth the cost of its materials. Brass bastions obey magical programming imprinted at the time of their creation or follow commands from their owners. Most can't speak, but a few have magical voices and can parrot simple phrases, recite poetry, or tell bedtime stories at the crafter's fancy.</p>\n<h2>Brass Scraps</h2>\n<p>On the Plane of Fire, destroyed brass bastions are sold as scrap to enterprising ifrits, who reforge the remains into new brass bastions. Many ifrits pay more for the remains of a brass bastion crafted by their rivals yet react violently when offered brass bastion remains they originally created. Thus, identifying a brass bastion's original crafter is a valued skill. Few non-ifrits dare trade in brass bastion scraps, save in extralegal markets.</p>",

Behind their maw burns a powerful internal oven, where the elemental creatures roast their prey. Brochmaws are driven solely by their voracious appetites, only leaving their lairs to acquire new meals. Early attempts to force brochmaws into service resulted in their would-be captors being reduced to nothing more than ash on a plate, accompanied by a written review of how they tasted. Now, brochmaws are employed all across the Planes, lured by the sweet promise of new, fresh meat.</p>\n<p>Though brochmaws have no use for money, they do trade gifts for services. The only thing they have to offer is cooked meat from their own mouths, which they deem extremely valuable. Surprisingly, all who have tried brochmaw meat claim it to be a savory roasted delight. Given that brochmaws offer nothing but cooked meat and desire nothing but raw meat, trading with them is a simple if slightly dangerous affair, often coming down to the quantity and rarity of the meat offered.</p>\n<p>Brochmaws hate to see meat go to waste. If one discovers a carcass of any sort, they call others of their kind to join them in a festive cookout, with dancing and feasting inevitably accompanied by compliments or complaints about the quality of the food.</p>\n<h2>Planar Delicacies</h2>\n<p>Though brochmaws love to devour new things, they still have favorite meals they like to keep on hand. Brochmaws love amphibian meat, though the origin of this appeal is a mystery. They will eagerly consume geniekin of all kinds because the magical blood produces a psychedelic effect. Brochmaws think celestials are as dangerous as they are delicious, requiring a precise cooking process to avoid killing the consumer. Most brochmaws are far too impatient to prepare celestial meat properly, often to disastrous results.</p>",

Each mood that cycles through the pieces of their face is a massively amplified facet of their personality, rather than a completely different individual. The differences are subtle to most observers, but a capritellix can display numerous mood combinations—typically 64 for one with four faces per disc or 125 for one with five faces per disc. No matter how much they change their face, however, capritellixes can't suppress their haughty ego or shake the ceaseless despair they feel. The conflicting priorities of each mood within a capritellix make it difficult for any of these creatures to make long-term plans or form solid relationships. What one face builds up, another undermines, cursed all the while with full knowledge of the former intentions they will never fulfill and the well-laid plans they will abandon.</p>\n<h2>Recycled Remains</h2>\n<p>When horribly damaged or weary, capritellixes travel to a communal necropolis, much like a fabled elephant graveyard.

A cullitox's hunger for gems will lead it to travel almost anywhere, even through planar tears. Occasionally, they even establish colonies on planes other than their own, should their newfound territory prove filled with crystals.</p>\n<p>A cullitox's scorpion-like body glitters with crystal. As light refracts between the facets, they concentrate and absorb it, energizing the cullitox and, some say, fueling the creature's magic.</p>\n<p>Cullitoxes form small communities in locations where crystals are plentiful, working alongside one another to track down anything from a common quartz to precious rubies and sapphires. Scouting parties use their innate magic to communicate with each other via light and wordless sound, as well as to seek out more crystals. However, when precious stone resources grow scarce, cullitoxes become independent and territorial about their supply, taking crystals from wherever they can, even seizing them from other creatures.</p>\n<p>A cullitox's drive to gather crystals is akin to the drive to reproduce. As a cullitox gathers stones, it stores them within its body. Once the cullitox has enough stored material, the parent fuses its stores into a tiny replica of itself and extrudes the infant cullitox, sometimes referred to as a shardling, into the world. The process leaves the parent weakened for a short time, until it can gather enough crystal to repair its body and begin the process anew. Infant cullitoxes consume crystals in a similar way. They process the raw material over a few months to grow to adult size. Thereafter, a cullitox \"eats\" stone only to heal injuries.</p>\n<h2>Internal Gems</h2>\n<p>When a cullitox dies, its body breaks into fragments of crystal. Some of these pieces are valuable, but potentially more lucrative are the gems the cullitox has stored inside its body to produce offspring. It takes semiprecious and precious stones worth 500 gp to produce an infant cullitox, though most slain cullitoxes have only a fraction of this amount stored. Once the stones become a new cullitox, they transform into the crystal of the infant's body, no longer the treasured material they once were.</p>",

The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weather—weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

Their efforts instill tactical knowledge in these fruit warriors so they're prepared to fight as soon as they fall from the tree—which they do simultaneously, forming one battle-ready unit. Each soldier is equal in skill and similar in form, with a wooden outer shell that splits into portions as the flesh of the fruit inside ripens. A slain warrior contains seeds within its body that can slowly germinate in rich soil with enough water—or blood. Every battlefield can become a new garden.</p>",

Vegetable lambs grow on rooted stalks, from which they can't be removed until they've matured (or perhaps ripened), leaving them dependent on their immediate surroundings for food. Moss sloths are little more than lumps of green fluff for the first century of their existence, only gaining limited mobility once they can grow their defensive wooden claws.</p>\n<h2>Wild But Unwild</h2>\n<p>Many wood elementals are created by kizidhars and other powerful creatures on the Plane of Wood and placed in rote roles. Populating nature preserves and sprawling estates, they can be unsure how to behave if released into the wild. They're essentially born domesticated and will likely act far differently than the wild creatures they mimic, even in natural environments. Their natural predators are few, putting the elementals at less risk, although they're still sometimes eaten by giant termites or captured by some as pets.</p>\n<h2>A Brain By Any Other Name</h2>\n<p>Even if Lady Shumunue taught the wood elementals' ancestors to mimic animals, a wood elemental's consciousness is contained not in a brain but in its root system. Entities like nursery crawlers, living groves, and carved beasts use this to their advantage. That an elemental's wooden body can be carved and crafted, apparently without lasting harm, implies that they might not feel pain so long as their roots remain undamaged.</p>",

Lomori sprouts meticulously collect the trimmings, seeds, and debris from the flora in their care. They plant the seeds to yield new growth and frenetically weave the rest into nests, spheres, and other simple objects. They're shy and skittish, often losing themselves in their labors, but they're always friendly to those who treat their gardens with respect.</p>\n<p>Lomoris are aeon spirits dispatched to the elemental planes long ago to pursue the act of creation. While most of the aeons dispatched to the other elemental planes performed their duties and rejoined their aeon brethren, those on the Plane of Wood lingered, becoming trapped as the plane receded. Over the ages, they adapted and evolved into lomoris. Today, lomoris have more in common with the other denizens of the Plane of Wood than they do with their aeon ancestors.</p>\n<p>Lomori sprouts, much like conrasus, have a central black sphere, known as a lomori's core, that functions as their primary body and consciousness. Where conrasus forge a sturdy exoskeleton, lomoris cultivate a tall mound of prairie grass surrounding their core, which easily grows to be 2–3 times the core's height. The lomori shapes the mound as it grows, creating protective layers to guard their core and forming other useful appendages. Most lomoris have six intricately detailed, crab-like legs of wood that emerge from the lower half of their core, allowing them to rapidly scuttle across the ground or climb trees.</p>",

Unless summoned or attacked, they rarely leave the trees upon which they first formed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>At first glance, wood elementals might not seem to have the same destructive potential as their cousins from the Planes of Fire, Water, or Air, but don't be fooled. The woods can be a dangerous place.</p>\n<p>Though some resemble animals, the elemental beasts presented here are still plants, and their life cycles reflect it. Vegetable lambs grow on rooted stalks, from which they can't be removed until they've matured (or perhaps ripened), leaving them dependent on their immediate surroundings for food. Moss sloths are little more than lumps of green fluff for the first century of their existence, only gaining limited mobility once they can grow their defensive wooden claws.</p>\n<h2>Wild But Unwild</h2>\n<p>Many wood elementals are created by kizidhars and other powerful creatures on the Plane of Wood and placed in rote roles. Populating nature preserves and sprawling estates, they can be unsure how to behave if released into the wild. They're essentially born domesticated and will likely act far differently than the wild creatures they mimic, even in natural environments. Their natural predators are few, putting the elementals at less risk, although they're still sometimes eaten by giant termites or captured by some as pets.</p>\n<h2>A Brain By Any Other Name</h2>\n<p>Even if Lady Shumunue taught the wood elementals' ancestors to mimic animals, a wood elemental's consciousness is contained not in a brain but in its root system. Entities like nursery crawlers, living groves, and carved beasts use this to their advantage. That an elemental's wooden body can be carved and crafted, apparently without lasting harm, implies that they might not feel pain so long as their roots remain undamaged.</p>",

This mono-eyed, rotten stump launches seeds that begin to sprout the moment they're buried, whether in the ground or in a living creature's skin.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>At first glance, wood elementals might not seem to have the same destructive potential as their cousins from the Planes of Fire, Water, or Air, but don't be fooled. The woods can be a dangerous place.</p>\n<p>Though some resemble animals, the elemental beasts presented here are still plants, and their life cycles reflect it. Vegetable lambs grow on rooted stalks, from which they can't be removed until they've matured (or perhaps ripened), leaving them dependent on their immediate surroundings for food. Moss sloths are little more than lumps of green fluff for the first century of their existence, only gaining limited mobility once they can grow their defensive wooden claws.</p>\n<h2>Wild But Unwild</h2>\n<p>Many wood elementals are created by kizidhars and other powerful creatures on the Plane of Wood and placed in rote roles. Populating nature preserves and sprawling estates, they can be unsure how to behave if released into the wild. They're essentially born domesticated and will likely act far differently than the wild creatures they mimic, even in natural environments. Their natural predators are few, putting the elementals at less risk, although they're still sometimes eaten by giant termites or captured by some as pets.</p>\n<h2>A Brain By Any Other Name</h2>\n<p>Even if Lady Shumunue taught the wood elementals' ancestors to mimic animals, a wood elemental's consciousness is contained not in a brain but in its root system. Entities like nursery crawlers, living groves, and carved beasts use this to their advantage. That an elemental's wooden body can be carved and crafted, apparently without lasting harm, implies that they might not feel pain so long as their roots remain undamaged.</p>",

Flotsam and jetsam collect across the plane, and olobigondes are just one of the many creatures that have evolved to live among and consume this detritus. These flat, round fish are covered in a moss-like skin that makes them exceptionally difficult to spot as they hug the sides of flotsam, feeding off the waste that drifts into their wide, open mouths.</p>\n<p>While olobigondes are primarily detritivores, they've been known to lie in wait within a forest of kelp or against a mossy stone to ambush smaller creatures, such as water scamps or lone passing merfolk. The fish launch themselves from their hiding spot to take large bites out of their surprised prey, then grab the victim as it tries to flee. Despite their size and ungainly shape, olobigondes can move quickly in water, though their bursts of speed are usually short-lived. In addition to maintaining a firm hold on prey, olobigondes' mouths are filled with a unique toxin that weakens and decomposes living flesh. The hungry fish easily gulp down the resulting slurry.</p>\n<p>Ancient olobigondes grow truly immense, and their outward appearance evolves. There seems to be no limit to their size. Their skin even separates into plates with deep channels where water can accumulate, giving them the appearance of an entire patch of detritus rather than one piece.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Alchemists who travel the planes have discovered how readily an olobigonde's toxin can decompose flesh, and some have discovered ways to incorporate it into their creations. An olobigonde's corpse yields approximately 1 gp worth of raw materials when harvested with a successful @Check[crafting|dc:16] or Survival check (2 gp worth on a critical success).

Metal often needs to be worked to find its form and function, which may explain why many taloses seem to enjoy living among people, if not necessarily socializing with them. They often find themselves stumbling into jobs somewhere along the production line of technology, whether it's mining the raw ore from the earth, working it into wires and gears, or constructing the devices themselves. Some taloses resent and reject the expectations that they fill such roles, but many embrace their fascination with tech, often going on to become expert inventors. Taloses are therefore far more likely than other geniekin to make use of clockwork technology in their communities.</p>\n<p>Despite having long inhabited Golarion, albeit in small numbers, taloses have only rarely been recognized as geniekin. The largest number of them, and also the largest number whose true nature is known, inhabit Tian Xia. The traditions of metal as an element have lived much longer there. Taloses often find themselves drawn to discussions and study of elemental metal the instant they hear of the concept.

They ply the Boundless Sea constantly seeking new experiences, whether the next big wave to ride, a tasty delicacy to sample, or a piece of art to collect. They crave new sensations and often seek them out at the expense of others.</p>\n<p>If one possesses rare art, lost lore, or fantastic surfing or cooking skills, a tantriog can be a wonderful companion. They're charming and friendly to those they find interesting, but their interest can be highly precarious, dropped the second someone bores them. Tantriogs may even betray acquaintances if it would give them another interesting story to tell. This makes befriending one a tricky proposition, as nothing can be taken for granted.</p>\n<p>It's a mystery how tantriogs came to wear their current forms. Some say that, in the earliest days of the elemental planes, tantriogs were assassins of ice and mist who committed a crime so great that they're being punished for it to this day. Others claim tantriogs assumed their shape after losing a bizarre cosmic bet. One of the more popular theories about the tantriog's current form is that in the past, they used to be able to shift shape as easily as water molds to its container. In their endless boredom, they were trying out a variety of shapes when a sudden curse (possibly cast by faydhaans) caused them to lose their ability while transforming from a turtle to a crab, leaving them stuck between the two. It's said that any who can teach a tantriog how to relearn their morphing ability could earn the elemental's undying friendship. Whatever the case, the surest way to anger a tantriog is to ask them about their appearance.</p>\n<p>Conversely, the surest way to befriend a tantriog is with compliments about their appearance or their skills. Don't be too fawning, though. Tantriogs don't like being tricked or made to look a fool.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>IMPRESSING A TANTRIOG</p>\n<p>A tantriog loves seeing a new sight or impressive exhibition of skill.

They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",
