Yet, far from the picturesque feline companions they appear to be, angoyangs are actually terrifying beasts capable of peeling back the fleshy layers of their face to reveal a mass of long, toothed tentacles.</p>\n<p>Although most cats instinctively avoid areas where angoyangs roam, the unlucky felines who do encounter this creature are invariably entangled in the monster's toothy tentacles and devoured. In cities and towns where angoyangs reside, cat owners may find that their beloved pets have gone missing only to soon have a fluffy black-and-white cat coincidentally appear at their doorstep, looking up at them with wide eyes and mewing adorably. Angoyangs almost never attack their caretakers, who they see as loyal servants that feed, clean up after, and pamper them, and the creatures protect the people in their household from any would-be intruders. However, a caretaker who mistreats or neglects their angoyang ward is often met with a grisly fate. More than one coroner or gravedigger has inadvertently inherited an angoyang after being assigned to clean up the mutilated remains of a previous \"owner.\"</p>",

Owing to their slight stature and relatively frail bodies, anugobus are said to be particularly shy of larger peoples and creatures. Whether under cover of darkness, during a festival that draws people away from their domiciles, or simply whenever they think they're unseen, anugobus in folklore perform their wondrous restorations and crafting projects in secret nearly without exception.

Terrifyingly, it also gains an insatiable hunger for the livers of people. This hunger is so closely connected to a gumiho's power that if it abstains from eating liver for one thousand days, the gumiho loses its magic and permanently takes on its humanoid guise-also losing its evil nature in the process.</p>",
