      "publicNotes": "<p>Renowned in Tengah folklore as divinely gifted artisans and crafters, anugobus are a curious group of tiny humanoids native to the central islands of Minata. Countless stories describe anugobus sneaking around Minatan cities to tinker with and improve upon other humanoids' structures and architecture. Owing to their slight stature and relatively frail bodies, anugobus are said to be particularly shy of larger peoples and creatures. Whether under cover of darkness, during a festival that draws people away from their domiciles, or simply whenever they think they're unseen, anugobus in folklore perform their wondrous restorations and crafting projects in secret nearly without exception. Many popular Tengah stories feature homes ruined by a natural disaster that are then magically restored the next morning or unfinished projects like half-built bridges that are mysteriously completed while its workers wonder at how this was accomplished.</p>\n<p>According to most legends, anugobus are unparalleled masters of architecture and engineering and use this expertise to erect complex structures or greatly improve upon already-existing buildings. Some have questioned these extraordinary stories, but anyone who witnesses an anugobu walk on the walls and ceilings of buildings while improving them knows that such tales aren't that far-fetched. In reality, anugobus are as diverse as any species of humanoid, though they all possess innate gifts for mending and construction, and they can walk on walls and ceilings. Anugobus resemble exceptionally small humans with superficial similarities to Tian-Sings. Most anugobus stand no more than 2 feet tall and weigh about 30 pounds-a diminutive stature that allows them to move in and out of crevices and remain unnoticed by taller folks. Nearly all verifiable anugobu encounters have taken place on the isles of Minata.</p>\n<p>In many anugobu cultures, each anugobu seeks an ultimate life goal, which they call their wonder. A wonder is any particular project that enraptures an anugobu in a way no other will. Any project can be an anugobu's wonder, from repairing a majestic cathedral to hunting a particularly dangerous animal to exploring a mysterious cave. When an anugobu discovers their wonder, it's not uncommon for them to fall into an awestruck trance and commit themselves fully to completing the work, sometimes binging on the project for days or weeks at a time. When an anugobu finishes the last minute details on their wonder, their life's work is considered complete, and they spend the rest of their days aiding other anugobus with their own journeys or taking on apprentices to pass on their skills.</p>\n<p>Most young anugobus undertake not just one, but many apprenticeships in order to learn advanced techniques in their trade of choice. The apprentice depicted here specializes in construction and engineering, but an anugobu is just as likely to take up cooking, hunting, tailoring, or really anything that piques their interest.</p>",

Even when not making use of their acid, caustic monitors can be deadly predators: They grab onto smaller creatures using their powerful forelimb muscles and are remarkably agile, considering their size and weight.</p>\n<p>Most caustic monitors live among rocky terrain such as pebble beaches, natural caves, and along sandy river shoals. A caustic monitor's mucus corrodes only flesh, so its den is safe from damage, but corroded plant life near a cave is a telltale sign that a caustic monitor lives nearby.
